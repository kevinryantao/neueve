    Description:
</h3>
<p>
    NeuEve Silk is a natural vaginal suppository developed by a <%= link_to "gynecologist.", about_path %>
    NeuEve Silk naturally moisturizes and heals vaginal dryness and atrophy.
    NeuEve Silk is made with vitamins and nutrients to nourish the vaginal tissues.
</p>
<h3>
    What does NeuEve Silk do?
</h3>
<p>
    NeuEve Silk is ideal for women with severe vaginal atrophy, severe vaginal dryness, and severe painful sex.
</p>
<p>
    Many women who were unable to have intimacy for over 10 years, were able to have sex again, after using NeuEve Silk for a few months.
</p>
<h3>
    Who's NeuEve Silk For?
</h3>
<p>
    We generally recommend starting with NeuEve Silk for women <strong>who are over 50 years old</strong>, or have been
    post-menopausal for over 5 years. NeuEve Silk is our mildest vaginal suppository.
</p>
<p>
    For women <strong>who are over 60</strong> or have been post-menopausal for over 15 years, we recommend they order
    <%=link_to "NeuEve Cream", cream_path%> to
    use in conjunction with NeuEve Silk.
</p>
<p>
    We also recommend NeuEve Silk if you are
    <strong>over 40 years old and have a medical history of any of the following:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>breast or ovarian cancer treatment</li>
    <li>oophorectomy</li>
    <li>hysterectomy</li>
    <li>lichen sclerosus</li>
    <li>Sjogren's symdrome</li>
    <li>currently use antihypertensive drugs</li>
    <li>currently use antiallergic drugs</li>
    <li>currently use antidepressants</li>
</ul>

<p>
    NeuEve does not contain any estrogen, progesterone, herbs, or drugs. That makes NeuEve perfect for women wanting to avoid
    hormones,
    (such as breast and ovarian cancer survivors and previvors). NeuEve is also perfect for women wanting to supplement
    their estrogen replacement therapy with something extra.
</p>

                "reviewBody" : "I am 54 years old. For several years following the onset of menopause, I had been experiencing vaginal dryness that resulted in very painful sex with my husband. I normally enjoy sex, and I love my husband nad find him very attractive, but since this problem started, I found myself avoiding it as much as possible. The vaginal walls were thinner and less moist and elastic too, so whenever we had sex, the pain was similar to what you might imagine when you are wearing a new shoe that has rubbed a blister on your heel ... and you keep wearing it anyway ... rubbing up and down on the blister every time you take a step. No fun at all! Who would want to do THAT? There is a history of breast cancer in my family, so I am opposed to using hormones. Therefore, I don't want to take any kind of Rx or use any insert that has hormones in it, and that left me with very few choices. I have tried other products made for vaginal dryness on the market, but they were slimy and drippy and a mess. They offered a slight relief, but not enough to continue using them. When I found NeuEve, I was hesitant at first because it's a little pricey and, well, I had tried just about everything else without positive results. But I thought I would give it a try - despite my skepticism. I had to do SOMETHING. I read all the reviews and h-o-p-e-d they were true. Turns out, they are! After about one week using this amazing product, I could tell a significant difference. And now, after about six weeks of using it, I have NO PAIN AT ALL. If you are reading this wondering what to do and how to fix this painful intercourse problem caused by menopause, read no more. Just buy a box and try it. You will be SOOOO glad you did! I have since told my GP and OBGYN about this and told them to share the news with all their patients. It is surprising to me how few women talk to anyone about this problem at all - not even their best women friends. But ladies, we need to share this kind of information! I cannot tell you how well this works. You start with the Silk. It's an insert - and it's a little messy to put in because it melts pretty fast. They say you can freeze them first, but I never do that. It's best to insert it just before going to sleep at night. You use it twice a week to start, then later graduate to once a week, I believe, with other levels (I'm still using the Silk so not sure yet). Don't have sex on the nights you use this; wait till the next night. After it melts, NeuEve is kind of like a lotion that soaks into your vaginal walls and makes them softer and more elastic and seemingly thicker. Intercourse that has been painful for me is now completely and totally pain free. We do still use a little K-Y during sex, but I think we could do without that if we wanted to now. The difference for me is nothing short of a miracle. I was so worried that we would have to stop having sex because the pain was so bad, and now -- no pain at all! If you're wondering if this is a 'real' review, it is. I am not working for this company or paid by them in any way, though I am incredibly grateful that they have developed something safe and easy to use that works this well. Try it - I hope it does for you what it did for me!",

Had to do internet research to find out what that may be about: Found many women experiencing it, called symptom of Menopause! I've been using 3 different external feminine salves (which I love them all) for about out a year but was looking for natural and safe INTERNAL product. Found that in NueEve. I was scared to use at first and have only used Silk two weeks now and using the NeuEve balm at night, too. SIGNIFICANTLY NOTICEABLE difference. I have to say, Sea Buckthorn oral supplement (recommended by NueEve for help with vaginal dryness), which I got at my natural grocer's after more internet research, seems to be a SIGNIFICANT FACTOR in helping. At least I noticed dry eyes (which is what it was largely touted for in store/on bottle) and dry mouth subsiding in literally a matter of a few days after one per day. (Fiance even takes this and significantly noticeable for him, as well, with the dry eye/mouth relief--we live at altitude, as well.) Not sure what is working best or most, but, at this point, I DON'T CARE: I am sold on the Silk, NeuEve Balm (which is so creamy and I love the smell) and Sea Buckthorn combo (as well as my three other external natural balm products which I alternate and love) for now. I will update this review after I finish my eight weeks of Silk. I will say, as TMI does not apply here, after two weeks, we did NOT have to use the usual lubricant during IC (which he described as a 'liquid condom' and did not care for its use but it was the only way we could make IC even remotely happen before). Feeling like a better version of my younger self, with noticeable increased sex drive and now better climax (as both were before painful IC). Best wishes for all older women wanting to still enjoy life. New Motto: 60 is the new 40! At least for me, with NeuEve.",
