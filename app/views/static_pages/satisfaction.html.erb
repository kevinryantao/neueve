                <p>

                    If you have a fishy odor and grayish-white discharge, then you probably have BV. If you have any
                    other odor or any other
                    colors, then you may have yeast infection, trichomoniasis, or some other issue, and we recommend
                    you speak to your doctor.

                <h3>Conditions and Terms of Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
                <h4>For Silk, Silver, Gold, and Cream</h4>
                <p>
                    Our product takes between 2 weeks to 1 month before you start noticing a difference. Most women
                    say it takes between 1-4 months to have pain-free sex again. As NeuEve contains no estrogen or
                    hormones, so you should not expect it to work as immediately as estrogen.
