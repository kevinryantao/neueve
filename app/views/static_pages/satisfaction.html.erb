<div>
    Our organic ingredients are the best quality. Our suppositories and creams are completely jam-packed with vitamins

<h3>Your Satisfaction is Our Priority</h3>

<div>Do you have dry mouth or dry eyes? </div>
<p>
    If so, you may have Sjogren's Syndrome, and <%= link_to 'you should read this.', faq_path(anchor:'dryEyeMouth')%>
</p>

<div>Are you using the right formula?</div>
<p>
    Starting off, if your age is:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        60+, then you should start with <%= link_to 'Silk', silk_path %> + <%= link_to 'Cream', cream_path %>
    </li>
    <li>
        50-60, then you should start with <%= link_to 'Silk', silk_path %>
    </li>
    <li>
        40-50, then you should start with <%= link_to 'Silver', silver_path %>
    </li>
    <li>
        -40, then you should start with <%= link_to 'Gold', gold_path %>
    </li>
</ul>

<div>
    Do you have BV?
</div>
<p>

    If you have a fishy odor and grayish-white discharge, then you probably have BV. If you have any other odor or any other
    colors, then you may have yeast infection, trichomoniasis, or some other issue, and we recommend you speak to your doctor.

<h3>Conditions and Terms of Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
<h4>For Silk, Silver, Gold, and Cream</h4>
<p>
Our product takes between 2 weeks to 1 month before you start noticing a difference. Most women say it takes between 1-4 months to have pain-free sex again. As NeuEve contains no estrogen or hormones, so you should not expect it to work as immediately as estrogen.
</p>
<p><strong>
If you have used our product for 30 days, and have seen no progress, please email us at <%= mail_to "satisfaction@neueve.com" %>.  We will fully refund you for up to one monthâ€™s supply of our product. This offer is limited to once per customer, for life.
</strong></p>

<h4>For BV Clear</h4>

<p><strong>
If you are 100% sure that you have BV and you have finished using the entire box of BV Clear without progress, please email
    us at <%= mail_to "satisfaction@neueve.com" %>. We will fully refund you for the entire box of BV Clear. This offer is limited to
    once per customer, for life.</strong>
