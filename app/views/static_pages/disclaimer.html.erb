            If you have cancer or a cancer survivor and would like to purchase NeuEve please read this:
            <ul class="margin10">
                <li>
                    NeuEve is made with all natural, food-grade ingredients and hormone free.
                    It is safe for cancer survivors to use and the products do not trigger cancer.
                    However, a cancer by its nature could recur without apparent cause. It has nothing to do with the
                    use of our product. We hope that you can understand that for us to stay in business, we must
                    make a legal disclaimer that we do not recommend our products to a customer who has
                    had cancer. If we did not have this disclaimer, we could get into legal trouble and
                    bankrupt the business if a customer accuses our product for causing a cancer
                    recurrence. Then, we would not be able to produce this wonderful product that can help
                    many women in need.
                </li>
                <li>
                    NeuEve can help you find relief safely for vaginal atrophy. Many women with a similar
                    cancer history have done that. If you would like to use NeuEve at your choice, knowing
                    that we do not recommend it, you agree to hold us harmless in the future. If this is not
                    agreeable to you, please send us back a message to let us know. We will be happy to
                    help you and suggest the appropriate products suitable for you to purchase.
