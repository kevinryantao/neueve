                    <h3>Our Company</h3>
                    <p>
                        <%= link_to 'Lavax, Inc.', 'http://amzn.to/2g6tUUf' %> is an Illinois-based research, development, manufacturer and
                        distributor of all-natural,
                        environmentally-friendly personal health care products. We are a small, family-owned company, established nearly 14
                        years ago in Palatine, IL. Our goal is to utilize cutting edge science and technology to develop innovative health
                        care products to improve human lives. To date, our research projects have won three grants from National Institutes
                        of
                        Health and two Grand Challenge Exploration Awards from Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
                    <p>
                        All of our all-natural products have been developed by our team of scientists. We test our products on ourselves; we
                        wouldn't be selling them to the market if we weren't extremely satisfied with the results. All the formulas have
                        been
                        thoroughly tested and found to deliver immediate and powerful results, time after time.

                    <h3>Our Founder <br></h3>

                    <h4>Renjie Chang, M.D., M.S., Founder & President</h4>
                    <p>
                        Dr. Chang started the company in 1999, determined to apply the knowledge and skills she had learned from a long
                        career
                        in the field of Obstetrics and Gynecology and in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past three decades, she worked
                        as
                        an OB-GYN in the Peking Union Hospital in China, a faculty member of OB-GYN at University of Oklahoma Health
                        Sciences
                        Center, and a drug developer at the Abbott Laboratories in Chicago. She established Lavax, Inc. to develop an
                        innovative vaginal microbicide for preventing sexually transmitted disease with grants from NIH and Gates
                        Foundation.
                        While developing the sophisticated drug, she invented the all-natural NeuEve suppository as a spin-off. This
                        innovative technology has made conceptual breakthrough in womenâ€™s personal care: reversing vaginal atrophy without
                        using hormone. A patent has filed to protect its composition of natural ingredients. Because this product is a
                        cosmetic for personal care, not a drug, it can be marketed to benefit consumers much sooner.
