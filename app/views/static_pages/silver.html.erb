    Description:
</h3>
<p>
    NeuEve Silver is a natural vaginal suppository developed by a <%= link_to "gynecologist.", about_path %>
    NeuEve Silver naturally moisturizes and heals painful sex (dyspareunia) and bacterial vaginosis.
    NeuEve Silver is made with vitamins and nutrients to nourish the vaginal tissues.
</p>
<h3>
    What does NeuEve Silver do?
</h3>
<p>
    NeuEve Silver is ideal for women with painful sex, vaginal atrophy, and vaginal dryness.
</p>
<p>
    NeuEve Silver is also excellent for recurrent fishy vaginal odor or bacterial vaginosis. Many women with years of
    recurrent BV were finally able to break the cycle with NeuEve Silver.
</p>
<h3>
    Who's NeuEve Silver For?
</h3>
<p>
    NeuEve Silver is our middle-strength vaginal suppository.
</p>
<p>
    We generally recommend starting with NeuEve Silver for women <strong>who are between 40 and 50 years old</strong> or
    have been post-menopausal for less than 5 years.
<p>
    We also recommend starting with NeuEve Silver if you are
    <strong>under 40 years old and have a medical history of any of the following:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>breast or ovarian cancer treatment</li>
    <li>oophorectomy</li>
    <li>hysterectomy</li>
    <li>lichen sclerosus</li>
    <li>Sjogren's symdrome</li>
    <li>currently use antihypertensive drugs</li>
    <li>currently use antiallergics drugs</li>
    <li>currently use antidepressants drugs</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you've been using <%=link_to "NeuEve Silk", silk_path%> for 1-4 months, you can consider moving up to NeuEve Silver.
</p>
<p>
    NeuEve does not contain any estrogen, progesterone, herbs, or drugs. That makes NeuEve perfect for women wanting to avoid
    hormones,
    (such as breast and ovarian cancer survivors and previvors). NeuEve is also perfect for women wanting to supplement
    their estrogen replacement therapy with something extra.
