    Description:

<h3>
    Use D-mannose everyday to prevent UTIs
</h3>
<p>
    Each box contains 35 servings of 2g packets (70 grams per box),
    one packet for every day of the month plus a few extra.
</p>
<p>
    Experts agree that prevention is the best solution for
    urinary tract infections: No more missed work from your UTIs, no more expensive antibiotics that upset your stomach.
</p>
<p>
    The main ingredient in <%= link_to 'Dmanna', 'https://infl.tv/efyF', target: '_blank'%> is d-mannose: a naturally occurring sugar found in fruit that helps cleanse your
    urinary tract and prevent infection.
</p>
<p>
    Leading urologists recommend taking Dmanna's daily d-mannose packets to
    significantly reduce your risk of developing a UTI.
</p>

<h3>
    How does Dmanna work?
</h3>
<p>
    When bacteria binds to d-mannose, it canâ€™t
    bind to other sugars, causing the bacteria to detach from the urinary tract so it can be flushed out.
</p>
<p>
    Daily
    hydration is also crucial in preventing UTIs and keeping harmful bacteria at bay, which is why it's recommended to
    take your daily Dmanna in addition to drinking 2.8 liters of water or more.
</p>
<h3>
    Studies show D-Mannose significantly decreases the risk of UTIs
</h3>
<p>
    <%= link_to 'Dmanna', 'https://infl.tv/efyF', target: '_blank'%>'s daily d-mannose packets have been developed by scientists and UTI sufferers
    who understand the importance of prevention.
</p>
<p>
    Daily d-mannose has been shown in clinical studies to significantly
    reduce your UTI risk: Women taking daily d-mannose got one UTI per year on average compared to women taking daily
    Macrobid antibiotics who experienced an average of 6 UTIs per year.
</p>
<h3>
    Why Dmanna?
</h3>
<p>
    Cranberry pills, juices,
    concentrations, and supplements like Ellura have not been proven in clinical studies like Dmanna's ingredients have.
</p>
<p>
    Dmanna is also less expensive compared to similar d-mannose packet products like Uqora.
</p>
