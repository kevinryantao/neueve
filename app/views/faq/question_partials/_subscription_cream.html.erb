If you order two items from the "Ordering à la carte" box, you can click the button "add to cart" for these two
items individually, and the two items will be added into the same carte and you can get a free shipping deal when
the combined cost is over $70. However, if you wish to subscribe the NeuEve Silver for the monthly auto-shipping
program and buy a cream separately from the "Ordering à la carte" box, you cannot put them into the same cart. You
will need to purchase the two items separately. The Paypal computer program cannot combine these two items in the
same cart because these two are different types of deals. To fix this problem, after you place the order, you can
send us an email at <%= mail_to('help@neueve.com', 'help@neueve.com') %>  to tell us to combine shipping of these
two items. We will refund you the shipping cost of the cream.
