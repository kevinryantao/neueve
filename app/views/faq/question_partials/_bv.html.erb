There are two possibilities that the BV Clear might not work. The most likely
possibility is that your symptoms might be caused by conditions other than BV, such as
yeast, trich or other infections. Many infections can cause discharges and odor, but only
BV causes special pungent fishy odor. If you do not have the BV-specific fishy odor, the
likelihood is high that something else might be the culprit of your symptoms. The second
possibility is that you have BV but your BV is tenacious and difficult to treat. The BV
Clear might not be strong enough to relieve it. A sign for tenacious BV is the
pungent fishy odor, especially after intercourse and you have such experience for many
years and you have a doctorâ€™s diagnosis. In this case, you may find better relief with the
stronger NeuEve Gold formula. You will need to be more patient. The tenacious BV may
take multiple suppositories to recover, but you will notice signs of improvement, such as
reduction in odor and discharge, each time when you apply a suppository. If you do not
find relief after repeated use of NeuEve, you will need to see an Ob-Gyn specializing in
infectious diseases for a checkup to verify if you truly have BV or have other infections.
