Applying NeuEve for vaginal atrophy is like putting cream on the face to stop wrinkles. Even though you can put more
cream on the face and hope it can smooth wrinkles quickly, only so much cream can be absorbed. The reason is that
the skin functions as a barrier to block things from entering the body. Likewise, after inserting a NeuEve
suppository, only a small portion is absorbed due to barrier function of the mucosa. Most unabsorbed materials are
eventually leaked out, but slowly and inconspicuously. However, the longer the contact time, the more materials will
be absorbed. In this case, using an applicator appears to be helpful. Considering that the mucosal barrier may make
the absorption inefficient, each NeuEve suppository provides excessive amounts of nutrients. Therefore, even if a
small portion is absorbed, it should be sufficient to help relieve vaginal atrophy and dryness.
