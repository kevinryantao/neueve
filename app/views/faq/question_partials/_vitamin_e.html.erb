Vaginal atrophy or dryness is a dysfunction associated with aging, like osteoporosis. Let us use osteoporosis as an
example. To find relief for osteoporosis, you need to provide the right nutritional supplements, namely calcium and
vitamin D. Eating chocolate may give you comfort, but it does not improve the osteoporotic bone. Continue eating
chocolate for relieving osteoporosis will soon facing bone fractures.

Can vitamin E suppository stop, delay or reverse vaginal atrophy? The answer is "No." The cause of vaginal atrophy
is complex, but it is not related to a single vitamin deficiency. Therefore, supplementing vitamin E alone for
vaginal atrophy would be the same as eating chocolate for osteoporosis. The reason that you felt comforting is due
to the oil that dissolves the fat-soluble vitamin E functioning as a lubricant. You can get the same lubrication
effect just by using coconut oil. However, they have no effect on stopping, delaying or reversing vaginal atrophy.
On the other hand, NeuEve provides a collection of necessary nutrients, including vitamin E, to local atrophied
tissues, like calcium and vitamin D for osteoporotic bones. This is the reason why many women customers reported
that their vaginal atrophy has completely relieved after using NeuEve and the reversal of atrophy was confirmed by
their gynecologist doctors.

So far, more than 30,000 women have been using NeuEve for vaginal atrophy. Nearly all of them are previous users of
the vitamin E suppository. After they have continued experiencing vaginal atrophy, they realized that the vitamin E
suppository has no effect on reversing vaginal atrophy, and they have switched to NeuEve. Luckily the soft tissue
does not have a "fracture" like bones. As long as it is not too late, the atrophy can still recover with NeuEve.
