Estrace is the synthetic estrogen cream and it works fast to restore vaginal atrophy but the
trade off is that Estrace has many side effects, including:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        light vaginal bleeding or spotting
    </li>
    <li>
        nausea, vomiting, stomach pain
    </li>
    <li>
        headache
    </li>
    <li>
        vaginal itching or discharge
    </li>
    <li>
        breast pain
    </li>
    <li>
        swelling, bloating, weight gain
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
It also increased the risk of breast cancer, heart attacks, stroke, dementia and blood clot.
On the other hand, NeuEve is all natural, green, and food grade, and it has no
side effects, but the trade off is that NeuEve works slowly by nourishing the mucosal
tissue. It does not interfere with any drugs including Estrace. However, it is not
necessary to use the two formulas jointly. If you have a family history of breast cancer, it
would be a good idea not to use Estrace. You can achieve recovery sorely by using
NeuEve with a slightly longer recovery time. However, if you do not have a family
history of breast cancer and you want to have a rapid recovery, you can combine the use
of NeuEve and Estrace to cut its cancer risks and other side effects by half.

If one application of the Estrace cream lasts for 3 days, on day 4 you can use the NeuEve
Silk formula and cream. Then, after 3 days, you can switch back to Estrace for another 3
days, and so on. By using the two products alternately, your total Estrogen exposure will
be cut in half and you will still get the same healing effect with 50% reduced cancer risk
and other side effects of estrogen.
