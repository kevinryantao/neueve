The major differences are in their ingredient concentrations and timed-release formulations, which determine
their
strength and effective duration. A table is listed below to illustrate these differences:

The NeuEve Silk formula is milder, suitable for highly sensitive women, but it only lasts 3-4 days. The Silver
formula
is moderate and the effect can last for 5-6 days. It is designed for clearing odor and eases dryness quickly and
can
be used for both recovery and maintenance. The NeuEve Gold formula is more concentrated in certain ingredients
and
with extended release. It is designed for long-term relieving of dryness and atrophy and suitable for easy
maintenance
(use 1 per week) because it can last 7-8 days.

If you have had vaginal dryness and painful sex for some time and are not sure which formula is right for you
based
upon the flowchart above, it would be a good idea to start first with the Silk, then the Silver, and finally the
Gold.
Because the Silver formula can be used for both recovery and maintenance, it is sold in most stores that carry
NeuEve
products. If you use the Silver formula first and feel burning, you may be the sensitive type. You can order the
Silk
formula online on this website if it is not available in the store near you.
