Hormones have a chain of regulation from the brain to local tissues, especial the female hormone estrogen, which is
produced by the ovaries, adrenal glands and fat cells. Once you are on HRT, the body becomes dependent on
supplemented hormones and stops producing the hormones by itself. Stopping HRT abruptly may cause discomfort in many
parts of the body as the body needs time to regain the ability to produce hormones. NeuEve works well in relieving
vaginal dryness, but it is not a hormone and thus, cannot overcome withdraw effects due to sudden stoppage of HRT.
When you decide to stop using HRT, please do it gradually, say reducing 1/4 dosage in a week and taking 4 weeks to
wean it. NeuEve does not counteract with estrogen. You can combine the use of NeuEve cream and/or suppository along
with estrogen during the HRT-weaning period.
