The effect of NeuEve can be enhanced by other things, such as calcium
supplements. Calcium ions in the tissue activate mucous gland secretion. After
menopause women often develop osteoporosis, which reduces the overall
calcium in the body. All mucous glands reduce or stop secretion, resulting in
dryness. Supplementing calcium along with the application of NeuEve can help
women revive their dried mucous glands to relieve dryness.
