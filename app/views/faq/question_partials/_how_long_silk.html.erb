It is about 1-4 months, depending on your age, which often determines the severity of vaginal atrophy, assuming you
have no other health conditions.

In general, if you are:
<br><br>

<ul>
    <li>
        <50, you can directly use Silver;
    </li>
    <li>
        50-55, 1 month on Silk and then move up to Silver;
    </li>
    <li>
        55-60, 2 months on Silk and then move up to Silver;
    </li>
    <li>
        60-65, 3 months on Silk and then move up to Silver;
    </li>
    <li>
        65-70, 4 months on Silk and then move up to Silver;
    </li>
    <li>
        >70, 5-6 months on Silk and then move up to Silver.
    </li>
</ul>
<br>
After you move up to Silver, use the same time interval to decide when you can move up to Gold. The rule of thumb is
that the younger the age, the shorter the waiting period for moving up the formula because the aging effect becomes
harder to reverse when one gets older. Therefore, applying NeuEve early and often can help better defy aging.
