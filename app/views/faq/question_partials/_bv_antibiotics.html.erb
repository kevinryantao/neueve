Fishy odor is the most noticeable symptom and when it goes away, the customer knows that the product works and
report in their feedback. However, for those who do not have a noticeable symptom, it is harder for customer to
realize it has worked. Then, they might say that it did not work or were not sure if it worked in the review.

We have recently received one feedback reporting that the product worked for BV without fishy odor. The customer
said:
<br><br>
"I have only taken one of these because after the first one I got my period (so I couldn't take more). I will say
that it has definitely had an effect on my symptoms. How "permanent" I do not know, but that's more based upon my
experience. I am a 25 yr old, so I haven't been taking this due to menopause. I was worried it might not work for me
because I was less of the "dry fishy" BV and more the discharge, but it has definitely changed that."

You can try BV Clear Starter Kit. It has 3 regular NeuEve Suppositories and 1 bonus Gold suppository. Most women
with BV find relief with just the one of the 3 regular suppository. The remaining few women who do not find relief
after three suppositories. After we give the bonus Gold suppository, few women have complained that the BV kit does
not work. However, you need to allow NeuEve some time to work. One suppository lasts for 3 days, and 3 lasts for 9
days. The Gold suppository can be used in the end which lasts about 1 week. If the odor or discharge did not go away
at first, you just wait a few days for the NeuEve to work.

Do not use antibiotics, antiseptics (like borate or hydrogen peroxide) or douche when you are using NeuEve. These
products are counterproductive.
