Strategies devoted to inhibit virus replication and to control their spread among hosts need to cope with these extremely heterogeneous populations and with their potential to avoid medical interventions. Computational techniques such as phylogenetic methods have broadened our picture of viral evolution both in time and space, and mathematical modeling has contributed substantially to our progress in unraveling the dynamics of virus replication, fitness, and virulence. Integration of multiple computational and mathematical approaches with experimental data can help to predict the behavior of viral pathogens and to anticipate their escape dynamics. This piece of information plays a critical role in some aspects of vaccine development, such as viral strain selection for vaccinations or rational attenuation of viruses. Here we review several aspects of viral evolution that can be addressed quantitatively, and we discuss computational methods that have the potential to improve vaccine design.</p></div></section><section xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" class="KeywordGroup Section1 RenderAsSection1 c-section" lang="en"><h2 xmlns="" xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions" xmlns:meta="http://www.springer.com/app/meta" class="Heading js-ToggleCollapseSection c-section__heading" data-sticky-update="true"><a href="#Keywords" data-toggle="collapse" data-toggle-disable-clickoff="" data-target="Keywords">Keywords</a></h2><div class="js-CollapseSection CollapseSection c-section__content" data-test="collapse-section" id="Keywords"><ul class="c-keywords"><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Human Immunodeficiency Virus</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Influenza</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Human Leukocyte Antigen</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Viral Evolution</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Vaccine Design</li></ul></div></section>

They have the potential to generate huge population sizes in short generation times. Viruses in general, and RNA viruses in particular, exist in genetically heterogeneous populations because of their error-prone replication [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>]. These features make the evolution of viruses a phenomenon observable on short time scales of weeks to months. The consequences of the extreme viral evolutionary dynamics are of tremendous importance for disease control and prevention. For example, influenza vaccines need to be updated every year, viral variants develop resistance to antiviral drugs, and mild viral strains turn into virulent ones spontaneously. These global health care issues and others arise from the rapid evolution of viruses.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Molecular profiling techniques, including DNA sequencing, have produced an enormous amount of data on viral spread, genetic diversity, and infection dynamics. The integration and analysis of these data can provide valuable information on the evolution of viral pathogens. Mathematical, statistical, and computational methods are necessary to deal with those large data sets and to predict phenotypes form genetic data that ultimately can be used in vaccine development. In this review, we summarize some computational and mathematical techniques that play a critical role in understanding viral evolution and vaccine design. Specifically, we discuss phylogenetic methods for vaccine strain selection, statistical models of evolutionary escape from selective immune pressure, and virus dynamics models for therapeutic vaccines and attenuation strategies. Our major examples are Influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). They are all RNA viruses of great medical or veterinary importance and have been studied extensively.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">We also discuss current, approved experimental methodologies employed to the development of antiviral vaccines. Vaccine development deals with the four most important traits of viral evolution: virulence, fitness, diversity, and dynamics. Each one of these concepts has been subjected to intense studies but is still difficult to predict, probably because of the complexity of each trait and the intrinsic stochasticity of the evolutionary process. Progress in understanding the interplay of these factors will depend on quantitative descriptions and predictive models. Thus, mathematical evolutionary modeling is likely to play an increasingly important role in the development of new vaccines and the control of viral disease.</p><section id="Sec2" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2">

Viruses are not only a threat to human health, but they also provide attractive model systems for evolutionary studies due to their short genomes, large population sizes, and high genetic diversity [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>]. The extreme replication dynamics of RNA viruses, for example, allow for observing significant evolutionary changes over time. Hypotheses and theories about evolutionary mechanisms can often be tested directly with these measurably evolving viruses [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>].</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The mutation rate of RNA viruses is about a million times larger than the human mutation rate [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>]. Thus, RNA viruses display a huge genetic diversity and this feature is critical for survival of the virus [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>]. Virus populations are exposed to fluctuating environments when migrating through different organs and tissues of the host organism and when exposed to immune responses mounted by the host. Transmission to a new host is typically associated with both traversing various tissues and facing new immune responses, and therefore it represents a major bottleneck for the virus population. The genetic diversity of RNA viruses makes it likely that adapted variants preexist in the population even before the selective pressure has changed [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10" data-toggle="citation">10</a></span>].</p>

This idea was originally developed for self-replicating RNA molecules and termed quasispecies theory [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12" data-toggle="citation">12</a></span>], and then applied to RNA viruses [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13" data-toggle="citation">13</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>]. One prediction of quasispecies theory is the existence of an upper bound on the mutation rate beyond which the population cannot maintain its essential genetic information. Many RNA viruses appear to have mutation rates close to this error threshold [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>].</p>

Viral evolution occurs on different temporal and spatial scales and is shaped by different ecological processes within and between hosts. Integrated modeling efforts across these scales that make use of phylogenetic, population genetics, virus dynamics, and epidemiological methods are termed phylodynamics approaches [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR18" data-toggle="citation">18</a></span>]. Application of these techniques enabled the reconstruction of the molecular origin of the HIV pandemic [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19" data-toggle="citation">19</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20" data-toggle="citation">20</a></span>] and the explanation of influenza A epidemics by the interplay of natural selection and migration [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22" data-toggle="citation">22</a></span>].

It has been extremely successful in analyzing DNA sequence data and it is the basis for predicting phenotypes, such as protein structure or function, from genotypes. In the case of RNA viruses, which display a large genetic diversity between hosts, the different viral quasispecies take the role of the different species in the traditional application of the comparative method. Viral phenotypes of interest include immunological escape and drug resistance.</p>

While some bacterial families share common biochemical features, such as surface lipopolysacharide and therefore can be treated with common drugs or antibiotics [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24" data-toggle="citation">24</a></span>], viruses are typically different enough between families or even inside families, making the development of broadly applicable antiviral drugs challenging [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR25" data-toggle="citation">25</a></span>]. For example, the base analogue ribavirin alone or in combination with interferon, has been proven to act as an antiviral compound of broad activity in the clinical treatment of infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR26" data-toggle="citation">26</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR27" data-toggle="citation">27</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR28" data-toggle="citation">28</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29" data-toggle="citation">29</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR30" data-toggle="citation">30</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR31" data-toggle="citation">31</a></span>]. Overall, only few antiviral drugs targeting viral proteins are currently approved for use in humans [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR32" data-toggle="citation">32</a></span>]. Viruses that can be fought with chemical compounds include HIV, influenza virus, RSV, HCV, HBV, and the herpes viruses, including herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and cytomegalovirus.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">However, currently the vast majority of viruses cannot be controlled today with any approved compound and frequently not even all subgroups inside the same viral species are drug sensitive. For example, the 2009 seasonal influenza A virus (H1N1) presents a natural resistance to oseltamivir [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR33" data-toggle="citation">33</a></span>]. The efficiency of antiviral compounds is usually hampered by the generation of drug resistant viruses. Moreover, some compounds may help control infection, but only rarely can the virus be completely cleared from the host organism. By contrast, vaccines can boost the immune system response and, in principle, achieve complete clearance of a virus from an infected host. Therefore, vaccines are considered the best weapon to fight viruses.</p>

LAV preparations include viruses with reduced virulence, which means that they do not produce the disease when infecting the host, or they produce a mild version of the disease. Viruses become attenuated for the original host after serial infections (passages) in cell culture of different organism. This is the case of the polio vaccine preparation in monkey cells [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR36" data-toggle="citation">36</a></span>]. Infection of embryonated hen eggs is the standard protocol to obtain attenuated yellow fever or measles viruses suitable for vaccine preparation [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR37" data-toggle="citation">37</a></span>]. The rationale for this attenuation strategy is that due to the high error rates during replication of viruses, especially of RNA viruses [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>], the virus accumulates mutations in the genome that optimize their replication in the new host or new cell type, at the expense of replication efficiency in the original host [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR34" data-toggle="citation">34</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR38" data-toggle="citation">38</a></span>].</p>

For this reason, LAVs can elicit different effector mechanisms of the immune system. The intracellular replication of the virus can stimulate cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> cells because they can be presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Particles released outside the cell can also be presented by class II MHC molecules [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR39" data-toggle="citation">39</a></span>]. After immunization with the LAV, the immune system is exposed to multiple antigens of the virus in its native conformation. Once the infection with the LAV is cleared from the organism, the virus-specific immune cells remain as memory cells in the host. A future challenge with the wild type virus will trigger the correct response, i.e., predominantly cellular response or predominantly humoral response. LAVs are considered the most successful vaccines because the efficient and multiple stimulation of the immune system typically induces a potent and durable response [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR38" data-toggle="citation">38</a></span>].</p>

The viral genome consists of eight segments and is categorized by the serology and genetics of its two surface glycoproteins neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA). Several subtypes of both genes have been isolated from mammalian and avian hosts, including the two most recent pandemic strains H3N2 and H1N1 currently circulating in the human population and responsible for the 1968–1969 Hong Kong Flu and the 2009 Swine Flu, respectively.</p>

Indeed, the HA gene has been shown to be under strong selective pressure through immune surveillance [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR57" data-toggle="citation">57</a></span>]. Positive (diversifying) Darwinian selection acts at the antigen-determining sites of HA1, the most immunogenic part of HA. At these loci, significantly more non-synonymous than synonymous nucleotide substitutions are observed, and the rate of evolution is accelerated considerably as compared to other sites of the genome [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR58" data-toggle="citation">58</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR59" data-toggle="citation">59</a></span>].</p>

Both evolutionary forces, termed antigenic drift and antigenic shift, have been observed in human hosts over the last century. Antigenic drift refers to neutral evolutionary changes accumulating over time, whereas antigenic shift involves a change in genetic and serological properties of the virus due to new HA or NA subtypes.</p>

Variations of this influenza subtype emerge and replace each other every 2 to 8 years. The mapping of HA genotypes to antigenic phenotypes is based on a neutral network model, i.e., mutants are organized in connected, phenotypically identical clusters. The model explains the observed pattern of viral evolution, with periods of antigenic stasis and with episodic cluster transitions. During antigenic stasis the population drifts through the neutral network and its diversity increases. If it hits the boundary of the neutral network, the antigenic phenotype changes and the population continues to evolve in the new network. The cluster transition presents a population bottleneck and gives rise to a selective sweep which reduces the genetic diversity of the population [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR61" data-toggle="citation">61</a></span>].</p>

To predict the evolution of the influenza HA gene, phylogenetic trees were constructed based on DNA sequences derived from viruses during the years 1983 through 1997 [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22" data-toggle="citation">22</a></span>]. Eighteen codons were identified to be under positive selective pressure and the genetic diversity at these loci was significantly higher than at the other loci of the HA gene [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR59" data-toggle="citation">59</a></span>]. The rationale for predicting the next dominant virus is that extant strains with additional mutations at the 18 loci will be better adapted to evade the host immune response and thus have a selective advantage in the coming season.

Tajima’s <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">D</em> is the prototype test of the first kind [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR69" data-toggle="citation">69</a></span>].

They are used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between different viral strains. Three main approaches exist to phylogenetic tree reconstruction: distance-based methods, parsimony, and probabilistic methods based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian statistics [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR77" data-toggle="citation">77</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR78" data-toggle="citation">78</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR79" data-toggle="citation">79</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR80" data-toggle="citation">80</a></span>]. Distance-based methods start by defining an evolutionary distance between sequences and then apply hierarchical clustering algorithms to obtain a phylogenetic tree. Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic mean (UPGMA) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR81" data-toggle="citation">81</a></span>], an average linkage clustering method, and Neighbor Joining [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR82" data-toggle="citation">82</a></span>] are two prominent examples of this approach. Distance-based methods are computationally efficient, but the reduction of the observed data to a distance matrix presents a loss of information. Both UPGMA and Neighbor Joining can reconstruct the correct tree only under strong assumptions about the metric defined by the distance matrix and they are sensitive to violations of these assumptions.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Unlike distance-based methods, character-based methods follow character substitutions in the sequence explicitly. Maximum Parsimony is based on the minimum evolution principle and tries to find the tree that explains the data by the minimum number of mutations [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR83" data-toggle="citation">83</a></span>]. The method has been applied successfully to the analysis of influenza virus sequence data [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR84" data-toggle="citation">84</a></span>]. It is also computationally efficient, but lacks an explicit evolutionary model (other than minimum evolution), and it is not statistically consistent. On the other hand, probabilistic phylogenetic models have these desirable properties, but they come at a computational cost usually rendering exact maximum likelihood estimation impossible. However, approximate likelihood methods, such as DNAML [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR59" data-toggle="citation">59</a></span>] or QuartetPuzzling [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR85" data-toggle="citation">85</a></span>], and methods making use of Bayesian inference, such as MrBayes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR86" data-toggle="citation">86</a></span>] are applied in practice. For both distance-based methods and probabilistic phylogenetic methods, the choice of an appropriate model of nucleotide substitution is critical.</p>

However, the successful case of influenza does not seem to provide a practical model for HIV. One reason for this discrepancy might be the evolutionary dynamics of HIV which are strikingly different from those of influenza. Rather than the drift-and-shift pattern of influenza evolution which generates only a small amount of genetic diversity around the successful trunk lineage, HIV tends to spread out from an ancestor in a radial fashion and to generate much more variation. The worldwide diversity of influenza sequences in any given year appears to be comparable to the diversity of HIV sequences found within a single infected individual at one time point [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR62" data-toggle="citation">62</a></span>]. Thus, an HIV vaccine must stimulate a very broad reactive immune response against a large set of diverse viral strains and the genetic makeup of these sequences is much more difficult to predict from the currently circulating strains as compared to influenza. It is for these and possibly other reasons that the same bioinformatics-assisted vaccine design approach that is established for influenza, has not been equally successful for HIV to date. In the following sections, we will discuss extensions of the models discussed above as well as complementary mathematical and computational approaches that might be of help in search for an HIV vaccine in the future.</p>

Antigen-specific T cell immunity is HLA-restricted and therefore mutations in HIV epitopes that allow escape from host immune responses are HLA allele-specific [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR119" data-toggle="citation">119</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR120" data-toggle="citation">120</a></span>]. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutations have been shown to be stable under vertical transmission of the virus [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR121" data-toggle="citation">121</a></span>]. Thus, CTL escape presents an important driving force in shaping HIV evolutionary patterns. Differential HLA-restricted viral evolution has been observed in several HIV-1 genes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR122" data-toggle="citation">122</a></span>]. From a vaccine design point of view, it is pivotal to characterize CTL escape quantitatively in order to address limitations of immune stimulations and to minimize the risk of viral evolutionary escape. This task involves identification of HLA-specific escape mutations and prediction of mutational escape pathways.</p>

However, there are at least three confounding factors in this approach. First, viral sequences obtained from different hosts cannot be regarded as independent observations of the same stochastic process. Rather, these sequences share a common evolutionary history. Second, structural and functional limitations, such as the biophysics of three-dimensional protein structures, impose constraints on codon covariation and give rise to linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the HIV genome. Third, the host’s HLA genes are also in LD because of their close physical distance on human chromosome 6.</p>

PDNs explicitly represent selection pressure from multiple sources and model the dependency structure among escape mutations conditioned on a phylogenetic tree of the observed viruses and on the HLA types of their hosts. By analyzing 1000 individuals from a multicenter cohort, the statistical model identified a dense network of interactions between HLA alleles and HIV codons, as well as among HIV codons, reflecting the complexity but also the consistency of HIV adaptation to immune response [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR123" data-toggle="citation">123</a></span>].</p>

Several probabilistic models have been developed for describing the accumulation of amino acid changes in response to specific drugs or drug combinations, including Markov chains [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR124" data-toggle="citation">124</a></span>], Bayesian networks [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR125" data-toggle="citation">125</a></span>], mutagenetic trees [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR126" data-toggle="citation">126</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR127" data-toggle="citation">127</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR128" data-toggle="citation">128</a></span>], and conjunctive Bayesian networks (CBNs) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR129" data-toggle="citation">129</a></span>]. CBNs are a class of probabilistic graphical models that describe the order in which mutations occur. In this model, the partial order of mutations that maximizes the likelihood of the data can be learned efficiently from observed mutational patterns. CBNs allow for several escape paths with different probabilities and the partial order restricts the viral genotype space to the subset of those mutational patterns compatible with the partial order constraints (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1">1</a></span>). The rationale for this approach is that many combinations of mutations are never observed, for example, because they result in inviable viruses, or because they are too far away in sequence space from current strains to be reached on the relevant time scale. CBNs can explicitly represent the timeline of mutations occurring along escape pathways [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR130" data-toggle="citation">130</a></span>] and they have been extended to account for noisy observations [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR131" data-toggle="citation">131</a></span>]. <figure xmlns="" class="Figure" id="Fig1"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="MediaObject">

Because the development of drug resistance is a major factor for treatment failure, not only the current resistance profile, but also the likelihood of evolving resistant viruses is a strong predictor of therapeutic outcome. The difficulty for the virus to escape from the applied selective drug pressure is known as the genetic barrier and it can be computed based on probabilistic models of accumulating mutations [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR127" data-toggle="citation">127</a></span>]. Retrospective analyses of large observational clinical databases have demonstrated that estimates of the genetic barrier based on viral progression models are independent predictors of treatment outcome.

Therefore, computational models of viral escape dynamics might also be useful for vaccine design. A successful HIV vaccine should not only minimize the distance to currently circulating strains, but also anticipate possible immune escape pathways of the virus. Although it is unlikely that the complete picture of escape pathways can be learned from data, improvements in terms of hindered and delayed escape might be possible, especially in the context of therapeutic vaccines where selective immune and drug pressure together may constrain virus evolution significantly and result in control of infection.</p>

Gp120 and gp41 are the HIV proteins exposed at the surface of the virion.

The region of the protein that interacts with the CD4 cellular receptor is a hypervariable loop. A great number of antibody-escape mutants are mapped to this region of the HIV genome.

As described above, slowing down the initial exponential increase of the viral load has a negative effect on the viral set point. This type of imperfect vaccine is also called a therapeutic vaccine. In the case of HIV, it could help infected patients to control disease progression in two ways. First, it may reduce viral load during the chronic phase of the infection, and second it may reduce viremia below the threshold of inter-host virus transmission (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">3</a></span>) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR137" data-toggle="citation">137</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR144" data-toggle="citation">144</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR155" data-toggle="citation">155</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR156" data-toggle="citation">156</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR157" data-toggle="citation">157</a></span>].</p>

This trait is measured as the cell killing capacity, when considering cell culture experiments, and as the host morbidity or mortality, when focusing on whole-organism pathology [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR158" data-toggle="citation">158</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR159" data-toggle="citation">159</a></span>]. Replicative fitness is also highly variable among viruses of the same quasispecies, and in general, not directly correlated to virulence [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR158" data-toggle="citation">158</a></span>]. Understanding the evolution of these two viral traits is fundamental to understanding and controlling the spread of viral diseases and to the design of LAVs.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Since attenuated viruses may elicit a potent immune response without causing harm to the host, several strategies are being explored to obtain candidate viruses for LAVs, i.e., viruses displaying a reduced cell killing or replicative ability. Serial cytolytic transfers in cell culture tend to select viruses attenuated in the original host [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR160" data-toggle="citation">160</a></span>]. This is the case for FMDV or yellow fever virus among other viruses, and is currently an approved technique for several LAV preparations. Viruses selected after severe bottlenecks, such as serial plaque-to-plaque transfers, present a reduced fitness due to the accumulation of mutations associated with the Müller’s ratchet effect [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR161" data-toggle="citation">161</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR162" data-toggle="citation">162</a></span>]. A new promising strategy for the attenuation of viruses is the rational design and synthesis of viral genomes with a strong codon bias. This approach has been implemented for Poliovirus and influenza virus [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR163" data-toggle="citation">163</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR164" data-toggle="citation">164</a></span>]. The viral genome synthesized encodes the same amino acid sequence as the wild type virus but encoded by infrequent codons in their host cells. Viruses harboring fidelity mutations in the replicase genes tend to produce a quasispecies of lower diversity and to be attenuated <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">in vivo</em>. This feature has also been employed to the rational design of a Poliovirus LAV [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR165" data-toggle="citation">165</a></span>]. Other strategies conceived to limit viral replication include the design of specific microRNAs or zinc finger nucleases targeting the viral genome [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR166" data-toggle="citation">166</a></span>].</p>

One conclusion of these theoretical studies is that virulence can increase in the population under a variety of conditions [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR167" data-toggle="citation">167</a></span>]. The basic model of virus dynamics, however, states that less cytopathic variants are more productive in the long term of the infection, because the abundance of both viruses and infected cells is inversely correlated with the cytopathogenicity, <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">a</em>, of the viral variants [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR144" data-toggle="citation">144</a></span>].

Therefore, the fitness of variants of different virulence is density-dependent [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR168" data-toggle="citation">168</a></span>]. The cell competition model offers an explanation of several previous observations of suppression of high fitness mutants in dissimilar viral systems [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR169" data-toggle="citation">169</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR170" data-toggle="citation">170</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR171" data-toggle="citation">171</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR172" data-toggle="citation">172</a></span>]. This density-dependent selection due to varying efficiency of viral replication alone or in coinfection is reminiscent of the concept of a competition-colonization trade-off in ecology [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR173" data-toggle="citation">173</a></span>]. Here, virulent viral variants play the role of colonizers and viruses efficient within coinfected cells are competitors. The attenuating effect of competitor-colonizer competition appears even more pronounced if many viruses from a broad spectrum of virulence are considered.</p>

Mathematical modeling of viral evolutionary dynamics will therefore play an increasingly important role in vaccine design. It can identify genomic regions that are under selective pressure, support the selection or construction of vaccine strains, predict evolutionary escape from immune pressure, guide vaccination campaigns, estimate the effect of therapeutic vaccines, and support the design of new attenuation strategies. Most of our discussion has been in the context of RNA viruses and many issues are most pronounced for this class of viruses. Nevertheless, we expect most statistical models and computational methods to be applicable to other viruses and different pathogens, too. On the other hand, the distinct evolutionary dynamics of influenza A and HIV-1, two of the most widely studied RNA viruses, have highlighted the need for careful analysis of viral infection dynamics within and among individuals.</p></div></section>
