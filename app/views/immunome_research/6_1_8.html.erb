                                <p class="Para">Improving our understanding of the immune response is fundamental to developing strategies to combat a wide range of diseases. We describe an integrated epitope analysis system which is based on principal component analysis of sequences of amino acids, using a multilayer perceptron neural net to conduct QSAR regression predictions for peptide binding affinities to 35 MHC-I and 14 MHC-II alleles.</p>

                                <h3 xmlns="" class="Heading">Results</h3>
                                <p class="Para">The approach described allows rapid processing of single proteins, entire proteomes or subsets thereof, as well as multiple strains of the same organism. It enables consideration of the interface of diversity of both microorganisms and of host immunogenetics. Patterns of binding affinity are linked to topological features, such as extracellular or intramembrane location, and integrated into a graphical display which facilitates conceptual understanding of the interplay of B-cell and T-cell mediated immunity.</p>
                                <p class="Para">Patterns which emerge from application of this approach include the correlations between peptides showing high affinity binding to MHC-I and to MHC-II, and also with predicted B-cell epitopes. These are characterized as coincident epitope groups (CEGs). Also evident are long range patterns across proteins which identify regions of high affinity binding for a permuted population of diverse and heterozygous HLA alleles, as well as subtle differences in reactions with MHCs of individual HLA alleles, which may be important in disease susceptibility, and in vaccine and clinical trial design. Comparisons are shown of predicted epitope mapping derived from application of the QSAR approach with experimentally derived epitope maps from a diverse multi-species dataset, from <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and from vaccinia virus.</p>

This is especially true for pathogenic microorganisms. Integration and interpretation of vast amounts of data from the analysis of proteomic information, so that it may be useful to bench scientists and clinicians is a growing challenge. Achieving this goal is essential if bioinformatic analysis is to lead to improved vaccines and antibody therapies and to a better understanding of patient and population responses to infections, cancers, autoimmune epitopes, and allergens. Experimental approaches to definition of epitopes are time consuming and expensive; predictive methods can provide maps which could reduce the effort needed in experimental characterization.</p><section id="Sec2_46" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2">
                                    <h3 class="Heading">Current Challenges in Epitope Analysis</h3>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In reviewing approaches to epitope characterization described in the literature, both experimentally and through the use of computer-based analysis, three broad shortcomings become apparent.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">First, literature reports of experimental approaches to epitope characterization have often been narrow in scope, based on the response of individual patients, cells from a few individual donors or single strains of mice, or focused on isolated peptides. This has generated valid data, but which is specific to the narrow set of circumstances and not reflective of the broader host or organism population. Discovering binding affinity for an MHC molecule of a single HLA haplotype will not necessarily be predictive for a population of diverse heterozygotic individuals. Many literature reports claim T-cell epitope characterization but fail to report the MHC restriction (mouse) or HLA of cells used. By limiting consideration to isolated peptides, an important feature of cell biology is overlooked. Binding to MHC-I and MHC-II molecules is a competitive and dynamic process [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1_46" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_46" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>]. MHC molecules bind to peptides selected from among all those competitors which result from the proteolysis of the whole organism. Predictive determinations of preferential epitope binding can thus only be made when considered in the context of the whole proteome, or, at very least, the whole protein, but not for isolated peptides.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Second, from an epidemiologic perspective the outcome of infection is dependent on the interface between a population of heterozygous hosts and a diverse array of microbial strains. Many possible interactions of individual and strain are possible. Depending on the context, the challenge in vaccine design may be to choose the best combination of epitopes conserved across multiple strains of an organism to protect an entire immunogenetically diverse community (for infectious diseases), or to select the immunostimulant optimal for a specific patient (in cancer immunotherapeutics).</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Third, while there is broad recognition that strong T-cell responses are essential to good memory, and in many cases to effective immunity, efforts to characterize B-cell and T-cell responses have not always been well integrated.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">B-cell and T-cell cooperative interaction in antigen presentation has been the subject of many landmark papers [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3_46" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_46" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>]. More recently, Sette <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">et al</em> demonstrated that, at least for vaccinia, T-cell stimulation is specific to a B-cell epitope located within the same protein [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7_46" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>], pointing to a close determinant association between B-cell and T-cell epitopes. Cross reactivity, or polyspecificity, is a necessary feature of the T-cell recognition of epitopes comprised of MHC-peptide complexes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_46" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9_46" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>].</p>

MHC-II molecules bind longer peptides (15-20 amino acids) whereas MHC-I molecules bind shorter peptides of ~9 amino acids or less [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1_46" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>]. Binding of MHC molecules to peptides is characterized by a large degree of degeneracy and it is now recognized that a particular MHC molecule may bind peptides that vary widely in composition and origin [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9_46" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>].</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">B-cell epitopes may be continuous or discontinuous peptides, in some cases requiring multiple linear peptides to be configured together to make up a complete epitope [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14_46" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>]. Location of B-cell epitope motifs in loops external to the cell membrane may allow for grouping into a multi-component epitope. Multiple peptides may need to act together to provide an immunostimulant adequate to initiate a B-cell response. Batista has described the need for B-cells to have sufficient stimulation to form immune synapses, initiating and enabling the uptake of surface proteins [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_46" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>]. In other cases B-cell responses occur independent of T cell stimulation [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16_46" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>].</p>

Peptide epitopes are a major component of the overall epitope complex, or immunome, and are genetically specified. In many cases antibodies to bacterial proteins are indeed protective, and complement fixing antibodies have been used as an index of vaccinal efficacy [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17_46" data-toggle="citation">17</a></span>].</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Immunization protocols for laboratory production of antibodies have long recognized the utility to linkage to a known T-cell epitope [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR18_46" data-toggle="citation">18</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19_46" data-toggle="citation">19</a></span>]. T-cell responses to epitopes arrayed in an organism of interest are harder to evaluate [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20_46" data-toggle="citation">20</a></span>]. Those working in reverse vaccinology [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21_46" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>] have been frustrated by the difficulty of reliably characterizing T-cell epitopes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17_46" data-toggle="citation">17</a></span>]. Proteins with multiple transmembrane domains have proven challenging to express as sub-unit vaccines [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21_46" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>]. In understanding the interaction of B-cell and T-cell responses, it is therefore useful to readily understand the topology of epitopes relative to the cell membrane. In the case of immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines, the ability to stimulate a multifaceted T-cell response may be even more necessary [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22_46" data-toggle="citation">22</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR23_46" data-toggle="citation">23</a></span>].</p>

Hopp and Woods [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24_46" data-toggle="citation">24</a></span>] first proposed the use of amino acid sequences to identify the most immunogenic regions in proteins and recognized the relative importance of surface exposure, a concept furthered by Parker <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">et al</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR25_46" data-toggle="citation">25</a></span>]. By using various lengths of peptides as indices to produce scoring metrics, about 70% of the epitopes in a small set of proteins could be accurately predicted. A wide array of methods has been published since, but the predictive performance has not greatly improved [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR26_46" data-toggle="citation">26</a></span>]. The field has recently been critically reviewed by Davydov and Tenevitsky [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR27_46" data-toggle="citation">27</a></span>], who use a preferred binary classification metric AROC method of evaluation. Recalculated, the accuracy reported by Hopp and Wood and the contemporary AROC values are not substantially different.</p>

Thirdly, we considered a graphical display that allowed visualization of the output of very complex statistical computations to be desirable. Our conceptual model in approaching this third goal was the superior level of understanding of land use provided by geographic information systems (GIS) which overlay multiple information sets of physical and economic geography. We have applied this concept to the microbial surfome "landscape". In this paper we describe an integrated bioinformatics analysis system which we believe approaches these goals.</p>

Once developed these equations are stored for further use. Briefly, principal component amino acid analysis was carried out on the physical properties of amino acids measured in a total of thirty-one different published studies. In the NN each amino acid is assigned 3 numerical values based its principal components rather than the standard alphabetical representation commonly used in bioinformatics. This type of descriptor is commonly used in QSAR analysis where it is known as the "z"-scale [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR43_46" data-toggle="citation">43</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR44_46" data-toggle="citation">44</a></span>]. The principal component descriptors are uncorrelated, mutually orthogonal metrics, and embody about 90% of the variance in all physical properties of the 20 amino acids commonly found in proteins. The z-scales are not in themselves physical properties, but rather uncorrelated dimensionless proxies for amino acid physical properties that can be used predictively: z<sub>1</sub> is a hydrophobicity or polarity correlate, z<sub>2</sub> a size correlate and z<sub>3</sub> an electronic correlate. A characteristic of principal component analysis is that it also produces a set of descriptors that are appropriately weighted for regression analysis. This process is described in detail in a companion paper where it is benchmarked against several other prediction schemes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29_46" data-toggle="citation">29</a></span>].</p>

These numerical values are then used to compute predicted binding affinities for peptides in the proteome using the NN prediction equations from Process A.</p>

We have variously used PHOBIUS [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR45_46" data-toggle="citation">45</a></span>], PHILIUS [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR46_46" data-toggle="citation">46</a></span>], MEMSAT [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR47_46" data-toggle="citation">47</a></span>], and TMH [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR48_46" data-toggle="citation">48</a></span>]. The output is a probability prediction for each amino acid in the protein as being intracellular, extracellular, within a membrane or a signal peptide. A determination of B-cell epitope predictions is also made. Unlike the MHC predictions which provide a predicted affinity, in the case of B-cell epitopes we are making a binary "yes-no" probability prediction that a specific amino acid lies in a B-cell epitope. The B-cell epitope probability may be achieved by submission to one of several publicly available programs for B-cell epitope predictions [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR28_46" data-toggle="citation">28</a></span>], however we generated a B-cell epitope prediction based on principal components, enabling us to achieve this step as an integral part of the process.</p>

As described herein the distance was set at 3 amino acids.</p>

Standardization is a common statistical process where the data points are transformed to a mean of zero and unit variance (and standard deviation as the standard deviation is the square root of the variance). Thus all binding affinities of all different supertypes, and paired supertype combinations, were put on the same basis for further computations. This process is reversible so that a more experimentally meaningful ic<sub>50</sub> can be obtained at any point if desired. Secondly, the Bayesian probabilities for each individual amino acid being in a B-cell epitope were subjected to global standardization like that for the MHC binding affinities. Thus, all the peptides and other metrics subject to statistical screening are standardized, so that thresholding or other selections are made on single or joint normal probability distributions.</p>

Predictions for MHC-I and MHC-II binding were done routinely for all organisms, although it is recognized that MHC-I is generally considered most relevant for intracellular infectious organisms and MHC-II for extracellular organisms. Simultaneous visualization of both provides a method of conceptualization of potential cross-presentation of epitopes.</p>

The Y axis is in standardized units (zero mean, unit std dev) to show MHC binding affinity. Topological information is displayed in the background shading. The permuted minima ln(ic50) representing the mean population phenotype are plotted for MHC-I and/or MHC-II at each peptide position the number representing a mean of 105 (MHC-II) or 630 (MHC-I) allelic combinations at that position. This is windowed average minima ± 4 amino acids from the plotted point. A smooth line fit through the points is produced using the polynomial filter of Savistsky and Golay [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR49_46" data-toggle="citation">49</a></span>]. Another line is overlaid to show the standardized probability of B-cell epitope binding. Across the base of the graphic we use ribbons of various colors and intensities to designate regions of high binding affinity and coincidence of B-cell and MHC binding. Different thresholding stringencies can be applied to the ribbons (see Additional File <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM5_46">5</a></span>); we have mostly found that the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of the permuted minimum distribution of MHC binding along with the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of B-cell epitope probability to be useful thresholds and these are used throughout the graphics below. The 25<sup>th</sup> percentile should be clearly understood to be a threshold from within the permuted minima distributions that have their own mean and standard deviations, and not the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile of all peptides. Colored vertical lines are used to show the behavior of any particular HLA allele as compared to the permuted population phenotype. The line extends from the permuted population value to the standardized value of the indicated HLA at the N-terminus of the peptide 9-mer or 15-mer. By creating a further overlay experimentally defined epitopes can be compared with predictions. The display can easily be rescaled to visualize the individual amino acids in the peptides.</p>

Predicted B-cell epitopes were found to be located inside and outside the bacterial cell membrane, but virtually none in the transmembrane domains, perhaps due to alpha helical structure of the transmembrane peptides. In the very few instances where extension into membranes did occur (&lt;2%), the predicted B-cell epitope only penetrated a few amino acids. This may represent an error in the prediction of the edge of the transmembrane domain.</p>

                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The array of genetic variants (supertypes) of HLA molecules in the human population vastly exceeds that for which there are peptide training sets. Additionally, and yet further increasing the combinatorial possibilities, is the fact that each individual has both parental genotypes of MHC on their cell membranes. Despite the combinatorial complexity, examination of the statistics of the predicted binding affinities to a number of different proteins in the proteome of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> gave rise to several observations which suggested that it would be possible to derive a system for determining the probability of binding not only for single supertypes, but for a population of combinatorial supertypes for which a trained NN was available. The processes outlined above make it possible to put entire proteomes (or multiple proteomes) consisting of millions of binding affinities into a single data table, in a familiar spreadsheet interface on a standard workstation computer.</p>
                                    <div xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3_46">3</a></span> shows the predicted binding affinities for each of the DRB supertypes in combination with each of the other DRB molecules (105 permutations) simulating heterozygous individuals (detail in Additional File <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM6_46">6</a></span>). Inside an antigen presenting cell where peptides from a digested organism (e.g. <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> COL) are coming into contact with MHC-II molecules, those molecules with higher affinity (smaller of the two ln affinity numbers) would be expected to dominate in the binding process. One of the striking features that emerges from this table (bottom rows Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3_46">3</a></span>) is the overall advantage of heterozygosity. Individuals randomly inheriting combinational pairs of the 14 supertypes stand to have a higher binding affinity than if they had only one type. A second observation is the segregation of different alleles within the sorted list. The heterozygosity advantage and the 10 percentile threshold, being in a range considered a useful biological range of affinity, suggested the possibility of averaging over all genotypes as a means of predicting binding in a population of individuals carrying MHC-II molecules of unknown genotype on their cells (as would be the case in a randomly selected vaccinee population). These results suggest that combinatorial pairs of supertypes need to be considered in statistical selection and screening processes, for example in clinical trials.<figure xmlns="" id="Tab3_46" class="FigureTable"><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 3</span>

Not only does the binding affinity vary across different MHC alleles as described above, it also varies between proteins in a proteome, giving rise to distributions like that seen in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2_46">2</a></span>. This clearly demonstrates why any organism-level conclusions about binding affinity cannot be made based on measurements made on peptides in isolation and should preferably not be made on individual proteins. The global standardization process based on standardized ln(ic50) ranks all peptides and produces a ranking of affinities of all peptides in a proteome against all other peptides in that proteome. This is the situation that would arise as an infectious organism is digested in an antigen presenting cell.</p>

This can be seen by undulations in the averaged mean affinities across a protein sequence. Not only was this the case among MHC-II supertypes, but was also seen with the overall means of all MHC-I and MHC-II supertypes (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3_46">3</a></span>; Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab4_46">4</a></span>). After examining many different proteins individually it emerged that each protein has a characteristic undulation pattern regardless of the supertype or MHC. Computed on an affinity basis the variations are very large with the mean affinity varying over a thousand-fold for peptides from different regions within a protein molecule. This long-range variation is superimposed on a large peptide to peptide variation within the protein.<figure xmlns="" class="Figure" id="Fig3_46"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="MediaObject">

Based on these concepts we developed a system to compute an average of standardized affinities for the permuted pairs for all supertypes within an adjustable (filtering) window. The window is defined as a stretch of contiguous amino acids positions over which averaging was carried out. Various windows (filtering stringencies) were tested, but the most useful smoothing was achieved with a window of ± half the size of the binding pocket (± 4 amino acids) as shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4_46">4</a></span>.<figure xmlns="" class="Figure" id="Fig4_46"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="MediaObject">

In practice, the range of affinity constants in a pool of peptides may be as much as 1000 fold so that higher affinity peptides will very rapidly occupy the MHC binding site and remain bound in place. For MHC-I, with closed ends on the binding pocket, the possibilities are more limited.</p>

Several tests of the potential impact of proteasomal cleavage were carried out with the webserver NetChop 3.1 at CBS on sample protein sets (not shown). From those experiments it appears that peptides are very likely to be cut into pieces shorter than 9 amino acids, so that the MHC-I presentation of a peptide is the result of interception and capture by the MHC binding reaction during proteolytic cleavage. The patterns of proteolytic cleavage of proteins by lysozomal enzymes suggest that they would be equally aggressive and that peptide processing for MHC-II presentation would be expected to be comparable.</p>

Through experimentation we found that this process produced metrics whose undulations tracked the visually obvious patterns of MHC binding in proteins (as seen in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3_46">3</a></span>). As the numbers were drawn from a standardized dataset the resulting sample were also normally distributed albeit at a distance (negative) from the population mean as a whole. Thus, statistical thresholds could be applied to these metrics that were based on normal populations. Each allelic combination was given an equal weight. This is a generalizable concept; it is also possible to compute the predicted population phenotype for various subpopulations using appropriate weighting for genetic frequencies. The windowing operation is not dependent on standardized populations and the actual ln(ic50) can be used as well to compute a running average of binding affinity for any single allele.</p>

Selected coincident epitope groups comprising regions of proteins where peptides met three criteria were determined. In these both binding threshold for MHC and the B-cell epitope probability threshold were in the 10 percentile range and the run of amino acids in the predicted BEPI peptide was ≥4 amino acids. Selection of the 10th percentile in two characteristics in normally distributed variables on a probability basis should be a product of two probabilities or about a 1% coincidence where MHC binding regions overlapped either partially or completely with predicted B-epitope regions.</p>

In Additional File <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM3_46">3</a></span>, Table S3a we tabulate the correlation between our observations of CEGs and the experimental findings for these. Much of the data pre-dates genome sequencing projects and thus reconciling the literature with Genbank is challenging. For example, in some cases peptides were reported with amino acid numbering without consideration of the signal peptide cleavage in the Genbank proteome repository. In some cases, such as with the staphylococcal toxins, the cleavage is substantially distal from the starting methionine. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6_46">6</a></span> shows the graphical plots with the published experimental results overlaid for two proteins; additional plots are found in Additional File <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM3_46">3</a></span>, Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3_46">3c</a></span> and Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3_46">3d</a></span>. We caution that our plots show the permuted human population average positions for MHC-II binding; publications may report on experimental results derived from single HLA or mouse MHCs. Overall there is remarkable correlation. Where the most detailed fine epitope mapping is compared to our prediction the mapped contact points either overlap or are within 5 aa. In other cases where mapping is not so detailed the overlapping is extensive.

In Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6_46">6A</a></span> predicted regions of MHC-II binding peptides and predicted B-cell epitope regions are shown along with the positions at which point mutations abrogated monoclonal antibody binding [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR51_46" data-toggle="citation">51</a></span>]. Several features are noteworthy in the patterns seen, as they appear commonly in proteins we have reviewed. First, the population permuted high affinity binding regions vary by over 2 standard deviation units. This corresponds to over a 1000-fold range in average highest predicted affinity binding. Regions where predicted high affinity human MHC binding peptides are absent sometimes extend over several hundred amino acids (see also <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> Protein A, Additional File <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM3_46">3</a></span>, Figure S3d). Second, regions with a paucity of high affinity MHC binding peptides tend to have long stretches of high probability B-cell epitopes. All the regions of monoclonal antibody contacts mapped by Brown <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">et al</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR51_46" data-toggle="citation">51</a></span>] are located in regions of where the population would be predicted to have high affinity MHC-II binding and the alignment with the predicted B-cell epitopes is strong. It should be pointed out that the 25th percentile (standardized) B-cell probability threshold is twice the stringency recommended by the BepiPred server; using a lower stringency resulted in all the mapped B-cell epitopes overlapping the predictions. The muteins produce a fine map of discontinuous epitopes and, thus, while the B-cell epitope prediction algorithms can only predict individual linear peptide probabilities, it appears that they reliably predict sub-segments of discontinuous epitopes.</p>

Unfortunately, neither the HLA of the patients, nor the strains of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> were documented. There are several families of this protein and they are present in all strains of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em>. It is predicted by virtue of its signature motif as an ATP transporter to be a membrane protein. We include proteins of this sort in our surfome dataset by the use of PSORTb [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR53_46" data-toggle="citation">53</a></span>] regular expression motif identifiers. We found the equivalent protein in all <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> currently available to be in two groups differing by two point mutations. A notable feature of the ABC transporter is that all the mapped monoclonal antibody binding regions are in areas predicted to have high affinity MHC -II binding. Two caveats about the results point to a common issue when attempting to reconcile predictions with older studies. The mapped regions were selected for more detailed study by Burnie <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">et al</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR52_46" data-toggle="citation">52</a></span>] simply because the ELISA results for the peptides were more than two standard deviations above the mean. Hence there is not a complete panel of experimental results to compare the B-cell epitope predictions. Clearly the experiments would also have produced a number of peptides over 1 standard deviation etc. but those were not reported. As a result, the curators of the IEDB have classified all other peptides in this protein as "B-cell epitope (true negative)". No MHC binding results were reported.</p>

Based on the permuted population phenotype, we predict MHC-I and MHC-II high affinity binding peptides, and multiple B-cell epitopes, affiliated in three CEGs. The predictions for each HLA used in transgenic mice by Pasquetto [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR55_46" data-toggle="citation">55</a></span>] were examined. HLA-A*0201 (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig7_46">7A</a></span> and at higher resolution in 7C) shows a peak of very high affinity binding for the aa 211-219 peptide RLYDYFTRV, a remarkable 3.95 deviations below the mean. The predicted initial amino acid of this peak binding coincides exactly with the initial arginine in the 9-mer described by Pasquetto [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR55_46" data-toggle="citation">55</a></span>]. Interestingly, we also predict that HLA-A*0201 mice should detect binding of a similar high affinity starting at amino acid 74. As there are ten B-cell binding regions in the top 25% probability, any one or a combination of these could account for the linked epitope response noted by Sette <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">et al</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7_46" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>], however a group of three predicted B-cell epitopes lie within positions 198-233.

When a given protein is broken down into sequential peptides (9-mers or 15-mers) and binding is compared against an array of all HLAs, it is possible to map areas of higher and lower predicted binding affinity and there is general concordance between HLAs. Distribution is non-random and areas of high binding can be defined on a population basis. We observed closer positive correlation within MHC-IIs at any given peptide than within MHC-I. This non-random distribution and areas of high binding affinity make it possible to plot a population phenotype binding affinity (using the permuted pairs) and accurately predict peptides which will serve as high affinity MHC binders for the population at large, given that all have the benefit of heterozygous alleles (e.g. in mass vaccination). We have designed the system to permit variation of the stringency in evaluating binding affinity, but have focused on the top 25% binding affinity.</p>

These differences between individual HLAs point to associations of HLA with a number of diseases, and in particular the opportunity to construct personalized vaccines with knowledge of the patient's HLAs. It also has implications when isolated peptides are selected as subunit vaccines for a diverse population and for the design of clinical trials representative of HLA alleles. Reassuringly, heterozygosity offers a distinct advantage in T-cell epitope presentation, bringing new meaning to the survival of the "fittest".</p>

The distribution of binding affinity determines which peptides are most likely to bind. Distributions of ln(ic50) binding affinities on a protein basis are not normally distributed across alleles (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2_46">2</a></span>). Some alleles approach a normal distribution but many show a bimodal distribution (i.e. peptides tend to be high binders or low binders, rather than medium binders). This characteristic makes standard statistical sampling challenging. Whether or not a protein has a transmembrane domain, some peptides are simply high affinity binders. Standardization makes it possible to establish thresholding criteria based on normally distributed populations and joint-probability distributions.</p>

In practical terms, only high affinity matters, so we developed a scheme for computing a running average minimum over a variable amino acid "window" (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3_46">3</a></span>). In the population patterns using the whole proteins plots (e.g. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig6_46">6</a></span>) we have used unweighted means, i.e. we have assumed all HLA alleles to be equally represented in the population. It would be possible to calculate phenotypes for various sub-populations by changing allele weighting.

The correlation with the fine mapping of the discontinuous epitopes for <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> IsdB [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR50_46" data-toggle="citation">51</a></span>] provides strong support for the concept that the B-cell epitope predictors identify linear sub-regions of discontinuous epitopes in proteins. We can speculate how, by hypervariable region mutations during antibody maturation, successive mutations might give rise to new molecules binding to additional short regions in the same vicinity and thereby lead to higher binding affinities for the new antibody mutein. By this concept a discontinuous epitope is a logical outcome of stepwise mutations during the maturation process. The reported "under performance" of B-cell epitope predictors [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR26_46" data-toggle="citation">26</a></span>] may be attributable at least in part to characteristics like those we map in <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> Protein A (region aa 325 to aa 475) and IsdB (aa 460 to aa 610).

Which begs the question "relative to what gold standard?" Given the multidimensionality of the interface between host immunogenetics and pathogen, a "gold standard" has to be specific to the combination of HLA and peptide. Furthermore, measurements of binding affinity which has been derived using peptides in isolation from competition from the rest of the protein/proteome are of limited utility. In light of this we do not believe a standard four quadrant (true pos, false pos, true neg, false neg) scoring system is achievable at present. There are presently few examples in the literature (except perhaps Brown <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">et al</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR51_46" data-toggle="citation">51</a></span>]) where the mapping of B-cell and T-cell epitopes has been done with sufficient detail to actually fill in the scoring quadrants necessary to compute an AROC. The three different types of epitope patterns mentioned above further complicate any attempts at developing a simple scoring system. Our prediction represents the theoretical maximum at any particular chosen statistical threshold. The higher the threshold stringency the fewer peptides that will meet the criteria.</p>

Timing of expression, or expression only under certain environmental conditions, is one filter [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11_46" data-toggle="citation">11</a></span>]. A further major determinant is the rate of proteolysis, first to make the peptides available for binding, and secondly to degrade them into subunits below the threshold of recognition of MHCs. As with epitope binding, enzyme action on the proteins of the organism as a whole is a competitive process. Proteolytic cleavage is a critical process which determines which peptides are available to be bound by MHC molecules and hence displayed on cell surfaces as potential T-cell epitopes, and when such peptides become available or cease to be available due to further digestion. A peptide may have a predicted high binding affinity to an MHC protein, but if it contains a protease cleavage site precluding binding, it may never be presented at the cell surface. This is a factor not yet integrated into the analytical system we describe primarily because the cleavage training sets one would need to produce reliable neural net predictions for the relevant proteases are not available.</p>

MHC-peptide binding is an intermediate step to presentation of MHC-peptide complexes for T cell recognition. We can speculate on whether a CEG represents a functional as well as a physical association. Given the consistency of the pattern, a functional association appears likely in which B-cell binding leads to uptake of the adjacent, overlapping or identical peptide to yield high affinity MHC binding peptides (via MHC-I or MHC-II), and, once bound, the peptide-MHC complex can lead to a productive T-cell response.</p>

The dual presentation of B and T-cell epitopes would be consistent with the B-cell-T-cell interaction proposed by Lanzavecchia [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_46" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>]. Similarly, preservation of B-cell epitopes by dendritic cells [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR57_46" data-toggle="citation">57</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR58" data-toggle="citation">58</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR59_46" data-toggle="citation">59</a></span>] would lead to the preservation and delivery to B-cells, not only of B-cell epitopes but also of overlapping MHC binding peptides.</p>

Generally specificity implies an absolute lock and key relationship. Rather, we see a pattern consistent with the dynamic competition for higher affinity MHC binding positions within the constraints of each set of unique host-pathogen interactions. Confronted with peptides from a different protein or different organism, the competition among peptides for binding to the same MHC molecules would simply be expanded. However, as affinity may range over binding constants of 1000 fold or more, there is a marked difference between high binders and weak binders. This is not inconsistent with a degeneracy in the binding specificity of peptides to MHC molecules. What matters is simply the ability of an MHC molecule to bind with high affinity a peptide representing the microorganism (or other immunogen) presented at that moment. The same MHC could just as well bind a peptide from another unrelated immunogen, not present in the same cell at that time. Given this multi step process, the effective "specificity" of the adaptive immune response is the product of multiple sequential binding affinities - {B-cell epitope binding }x {MHC binding} x{T-cell receptor binding to MHC-peptide complex}. No one of these steps needs to confer complete "specificity" but the combination increases the uniqueness or specificity of the antigen-immune response, essentially as a combination lock.</p>

Whether MHC binding regions located in CEGs have different roles from those MHC binding regions which are unrelated to B-cell epitopes is unknown. High affinity MHC binding regions located in membranes may be hidden until internalized and released by proteolysis, as proposed by Benacerraf [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3_46" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span>]. This could occur through internalization of whole organisms or when such peptide fragments are "towed along" by internalization of adjacent tethered peptides.</p>

This implies that the precise intracellular pathway, and hence which proteolytic machinery the peptide encounters, may allow such peptides to stimulate T<sub>CD8</sub> or T<sub>CD4</sub>, simultaneously or sequentially. Others have noted the need to understand the degree of overlap in the peptidome leading to stimulation of each pathway [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR60_46" data-toggle="citation">60</a></span>].</p>

Vaughan [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR61_46" data-toggle="citation">61</a></span>], in reviewing the literature on epitope characterization for <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Plasmodium</em>, noted that 14% epitopes characterized by some workers as B-cell epitopes are reported by others to be T-cell epitopes, a percentage not dissimilar from that seen in the surfome of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Staph. aureus</em> and the AntiJen dataset.</p>

At one level it underscores the utility of HLA transgenic mice as indicators of immunodominance (binding affinity) for humans [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR54_46" data-toggle="citation">54</a></span>], while also calling into question extrapolation of peptide level MHC binding evaluations conducted in murine inbred strains and raising questions about the need to reflect immunogenetic diversity in clinical trials. Taking a broader perspective, if each HLA shows highest binding to a very narrow peptide sequence in given region of a protein (immunodominant peptide) it may represent a risk of microbial escape mutants [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR60_46" data-toggle="citation">60</a></span>]. However, because other HLAs bind to different adjacent peptides with high affinity, heterozygosity provides a backstop. Viewed in an immunogenetically diverse population, it provides a possible survival strategy in which any one escape mutant does not threaten an entire host population.</p>
