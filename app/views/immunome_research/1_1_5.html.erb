The best results so far are provided by using various monoclonal antibodies directed against tumor cells, which won approval from regulatory agencies and entered clinical practice. Other approaches, such as therapeutic vaccines that aim at stimulating the immune response of the host against tumor cells, were much less successful [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1_5" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>]. Experimental evidence clearly shows that vaccines elicit effective responses against early, microscopic tumors, but are ineffective against established, large tumor masses. A similar situation is found in infectious immunity: prophylactic vaccines protect millions of individuals worldwide from pathogens, whereas therapeutic vaccines are mostly ineffective. Such results led some tumor immunologists to the idea that the effort should be directed towards the development of prophylactic, rather than therapeutic, cancer vaccines [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_5" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>]. Prophylactic vaccines against viruses that increase the risk of cancer, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) or papilloma virus (HPV), have already shown a significant effcacy in reducing cancer incidence [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3_5" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4_5" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>]. The challenge is now to devise immunological strategies for the design of prophylactic vaccines for prevention of those human cancers that are not related to viral infections.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Standard vaccines against viruses induce the primary response of the adaptive components of the immune system against the non-self antigen in order to activate the immune system memory which will then elicit the much stronger secondary response when the antigen will enter the body. There is no need to break self tolerance as the antigen is non self.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">At variance tumor vaccines need to break tolerance of the tumor associated antigens (TAA) that otherwise would be treated as self and not attacked by the immune system.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The effectiveness of tumor immuno-prevention was demonstrated in the past ten years in several mouse models of tumor development. Tumors in these models are induced either by chemical carcinogens or by transgenic expression of oncogenes. Among the most thoroughly investigated is the HER-2/neu transgenic mouse model. HER-2/neu is an oncogene involved in human breast and ovary carcinomas. The protein product of HER-2/neu, p185neu, is a membrane tyrosine kinase that transduces proliferative signals. A deregulation of HER-2/neu, for example due to gene amplification, leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Over-expression of a rat HER-2/neu transgene in mice was obtained using tissue-specific regulatory sequences derived from mammary tumor virus (MMTV) long terminal repeats (LTR). Various transgenic mouse lines were obtained using either a mutant, constitutively activated HER-2/neu gene or a normal, non mutated gene. Here we will refer to mice carrying the mutant oncogene, which are prone to a very aggressive mammary carcinogenesis, invariably leading to the development of invasive mammary carcinomas by the age of 6 months. The natural history of mammary carcinoma in HER-2/neu transgenic mice was thoroughly investigated and found to be remarkably similar to that of human breast cancer [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5_5" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>]. Immuno-prevention of mammary carcinoma in HER-2/neu transgenic mice was attempted using various immunological strategies, including cytokines, non-specific stimulators of the immune response, and HER-2/neu specific vaccines made of DNA, proteins, peptides, or whole cells. Most approaches achieved a delay of mammary carcinogenesis, but a complete prevention of tumor onset was not attained, particularly in the most aggressive tumor models [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_5" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>]. We achieved the first complete success at preventing mammary carcinoma in HER-2/neu transgenic mice using a vaccine that combined three different stimuli for the immune system. The first was p185neu, protein product of HER-2/neu, which in this system is at same time the oncogene driving carcinogenesis and the target antigen. p185neu was combined with the two non specific adjuvants, allogeneic class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) glycoproteins and interleukin 12 (IL-12). MHCI glycoproteins are responsible for some of the most intense immune responses observed during the rejection of allogeneic organ transplants. Unlike conventional antigens, allogeneic MHCI molecules stimulate a relatively large fraction of all T cell clones, up to 10% of the available repertoire. IL-12 is a cytokine normally produced by antigen presenting cells (APC) such as dendritic cells (DC) to stimulate T helper cells and other cells of the immune system, such as natural killer cells (NK) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7_5" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>]. IL-12 was initially administered systemically, but a more recent formulation of the Triplex vaccine used genetically modified vaccine cells transduced with IL-12 genes, thus allowing cytokine production at locally high levels that more closely mimicked the natural release of IL-12 [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_5" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>]. The vaccine cell (VC) that we will model here is similar to the latter one and consists of a HER-2/neu transgenic mammary carcinoma cell allogeneic with respect to the host and transduced with IL-12 genes.</p><div xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">A complete prevention of mammary carcinogenesis with the Triplex vaccine was obtained when vaccination cycles started at 6 weeks of age and continued for the entire duration of the experiment, at least one year (chronic vaccination). One vaccination cycle consisted of four intraperitoneal administrations of non-replicating (mitomycin-treated) VC over two weeks followed by two weeks of rest [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_5" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>]. We made various attempts at reducing the number of vaccination cycles, in particular we studied the effects of just three cycles starting at 6 weeks of age (early vaccination), or at 10 weeks of age (late vaccination), or at 16 weeks of age (very late vaccination). Early vaccination produced a significant delay in the onset of tumors, but all mice eventually succumbed to mammary carcinoma. Late vaccination was less effective than early vaccination, whereas the very late protocol was completely devoid of effect in comparison to untreated control mice (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig1_5">1</a></span>).<figure xmlns="" class="Figure" id="Fig1_5"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="MediaObject">

Finding an answer to this question via a biological solution would be too expensive in time and money as it would require an enormous number of experiments, each lasting at least one year. For this reason we developed an accurate model of immune system responses to vaccination and we use this model as a <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">virtual laboratory</em> to search for effective vaccination protocols.

This competition may possibly end up either with the elimination of the cancer cells, or the progressive invasion by cancer cells of other tissues or organs.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The goal of medical treatments is to enhance the immune response by activating the immune defense and/or specializing the ability of immune cells to identify the presence of the tumor.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The immune competition is a phenomenon which involves aggressive cells or particles (either external non-self pathogens or self modified or corrupted cells) and the various populations of the immune system. The immune system appears to be a distributed system which lacks central control, but which, nevertheless, performs its complex task in an extremely effective and effcient way. Complexity, in this framework, is driven by the fact that interactions are developed at different scales (i.e. the cellular dynamics is ruled by sub-cellular interactions) and different mechanisms operate on the same subject (mechanical for the dynamics and biological for the immune competition). The state of the art of the immune mechanisms from the view point of molecular biology are described in specialized literature [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9_5" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10" data-toggle="citation">10</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11_5" data-toggle="citation">11</a></span>]. Owing to the rapid progress of biological knowledge this is rapidly changing.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">A model, which is a mapping from a real-world domain to a mathematical domain, highlights some of the essential properties while ignoring not relevant (or believed not relevant) ones.

A computable model should then be able to simulate both the dynamic behavior and the evolution and interactions of the system entities which play the game. An understandable model must reproduce concept and ideas of tumor immunology while opening new computational possibilities for understanding the immune competition. Finally extensible models should allow the inclusion of new knowledge with a limited effort. The immune system is characterized by a great complexity so that it is very diffcult, or even impossible, to develop a detailed mathematical description of all phenomena related to the immune competition which satisfies all the above properties. A significant effort has recently been devoted in searching for an appropriate mathematical approach to describe the Immune System – tumor competition (see [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12_5" data-toggle="citation">12</a></span>] for a recent review). However, if one focuses the attention on specific types of interactions, one may attempt to develop <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ad hoc</em> models for a specific phenomenon at the chosen observation and representation scale. Extensive description of subcellular vs larger scales of modelling can be found in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13_5" data-toggle="citation">13</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_5" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>].

This approach is biologically very flexible; the behavior of entities is modelled using present biological knowledge and can be easily modified to reflect observations from new biological experimental results. Compared to the complexity of the real biological system our model is still very <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">naive</em> and it can be extended in many aspects. However the model is complete enough to describe the major aspect of the phenomenon and, after tuning the model parameters, it can predict the response to a vaccination schedule that prevented the formation of solid tumors in mice.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Our model, hereafter referred as SimTriplex model, describes the immune competition using an agent based method. These methods are nowadays very popular as they find application in various fields. However the idea of discrete agents whose global dynamics is able to reproduce macroscopic behavior has been introduced more than fifty years ago in the framework of fluid-dynamics.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">We used a Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) approach which allows to describe, in a defined space, the immune system entities with their different biological states and the interactions between different entities. The immune system evolution in a 2D physical space and in time is generated from the interactions and diffusion of the different entities. Extension to a 3D physical space is possible, but it would obviously have an higher computational cost. The major advantage of this technique is that the entities and the relationships can be described in terms that are much similar to the biological world. The intrinsic non linearity of the system is treated with no additional efforts. Models based on this class of techniques reproduce the biological knowledge of the system; so they are relevant, understandable and extensible. They are naturally computable but the computational effort increases drastically with increasing biological details (e.g. the immune repertoire and biological details). This class of model can be seen as the computational counterpart of the generalized kinetic model.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">To describe the cancer – immune system competition one needs to include all the entities (cells, molecules, adjuvants, etc.) which biologists recognize as relevant in the competition. These entities have internal states, birth, age and death (i.e. ages structure). Interactions between different entities will stochastically change the internal state of one or both the interacting entities. Space changes in the system are achieved with diffusion instead of collision (see 3.2.4). It is worth to remind that in the microscopic cellular framework one is interested only in the initial and final state. The model of the mechanisms which produce the change of state is deferred to sub-cellular models.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Our model is driven by the experimental data on Triplex, an engineered vaccine for mammary carcinoma tested on HER-2/neu transgenic mice.</p><div xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The model, which has been fully described in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16_5" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>] include the entities described in table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1_5">1</a></span>.

Plasma cells have no specific receptor (but contains the information of the original BCR). They produce antibodies with the same receptor as the B cell from which they originate.</p>

Cellular entities have age structure. They are born, they interact and duplicate (and eventually get anergic) and, after a finite lifetime, they die by apoptosis or by lysis. We need to keep track of the age of cellular entities; we do this by keeping a count of the number of time-steps since cell birth (from stem cells or by clonal division). To simulate memory cells, we increase the halflife of TH, TC and B cells after successful interaction with target antigens. The death probability reaches 1 when the age gets to twice the half life. The simulator performs the process of the thymic selection of T cells (TH + TC) as described in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16_5" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>]. Selection has two phases: negative and positive (both stochastic).</p>

Mutation occurs when a new B cell is formed, i.e. in the duplication phase. This effect is included in the simulator as a stochastic event; this increases the immune system recognition ability. The setup routine initially set entities concentration in the lattice. The Leukocytes form three general classes (Granulocytes; Lymphocytes and Monocytes) which are present in different ratios in blood, tissues and various organs. In our virtual mouse we initially consider 4500 leukocytes. Of these there are 4200 lymphocytes, comprising 1512 B cells, 1512 T cells (subdivided in 1008 T helper cells and 504 cytotoxic T cells) and 1176 natural killer cells. There are 300 monocytes divided in 150 macrophages and 150 dendritic cells. The model does not have any granulocyte.</p>

First of all we must remember that interactions occurs only if two entities stay in the same site. Taking into account that a time step is 8 hours we can say that entities in a site are those entities that a single entity encounters during 8 hours. Time t = 0 corresponds to the atypical hyperplasia, i.e. first appearing of tumor cells. For "early schedule" time t = 0 corresponds also to the first vaccine injection. An interaction between two entities is a complex action which eventually end with a state change of one or both entities. Interactions can be <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">specific</em> or <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">aspecific</em>. Specific interactions need a <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">recognition phase</em> between the two entities (e.g. B ↓ TAA); recognition is based on Hamming distance and affnity function and is eventually enhanced by adjuvants. We refers to <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">positive interaction</em> when this first phase occurs successfully. Aspecific interaction do not have a recognition phase (e.g. DC ↓ TAA). When two entities, which may interact, lie in the same lattice site then they interact with a probabilistic law. All entities which may interact and are in the same site have a positive interaction.</p>
                                        <div xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">First positive interaction is between vaccine cells and cytotoxic T cells (<strong xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeBold">TC – VC Interaction</strong>). vaccine cells are engineered in such a way that are <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">presenting</em> MHC class I (status <strong xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeBold">Presl</strong>) and TC are in the state in which are released from thymus (status <strong xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeBold">Active</strong>). Then, if TC (CD8) cell receptor matches with a non-zero affnity with the allogeneic MHCI, VC dies by lysis and release TAA. Allogeneic-MHC present in the vaccine guarantees a non-zero affnity. Positive interaction produces TC duplication (state change into <strong xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeBold">Duplica</strong>) and increase TC lifetime of one time cycle (8 hours). Once TAA are released they can interact with Antigen Presenting Cells (APC), (i.e. Macrophages (MP), Dendritic cells (DC) and B cells) or antibodies. Positive APC ↓ TAA interaction will have the following effect: <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">i)</em> TAA is ingested by APC; <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ii)</em> APC will change state becoming presenting. A presenting APC is able to stimulate other cells (TC, TH). Stimulated TH produce Interleukin-2 (IL-2). A positive interaction TH B will change the state of the B cell into Plasma Cell (PLB) and the humoral response begin by antibodies production. This briefly describes the major interactions included in SimTriplex. They can be divided into standard interaction of the immune system (B ↓ Ag; Ab ↓ Ag; TH ↓ B; TH ↓ MP; MP ↓ IC; MP ↓ Ag; DC ↓ Ag; TH ↓ DC;) and interactions which occurs in presence of Tumor and vaccine (TC ↓ CC; Ab ↓ CC; NK ↓ CC; Ab ↓ VC; NK ↓ VC).

This model applies to the very early stage of tumor genesis, i.e. before a solid tumor is formed. <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">In silico</em> experiments show excellent agreement with <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">in vivo</em> experiments both for the time of formation of solid tumor in mice and the role of antibody response in controlling tumor growth [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_5" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_5" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>]. The model and its computer implementation are very flexible and new biological entities, behavior, and interactions can be easily added. This helps achieving a realistic description of the immune responses that target solid tumor formation.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">We found that a possible protocol which prevents solid tumor formation for the mice lifetime and uses a number of vaccine injections 30% less than Chronic schedule. This result shows that, at least in principle, a computerized mathematical model can be used to search for better protocols. The vaccination schedule we found is better than the Chronic one. However the question if this schedule is optimal, i.e. is the effective schedule with the minimum number of injections, or nearly-optimal is still open. The answer to this question is not trivial. First one should properly define the biological meaning of an optimal schedule; then an optimal/nearly optimal solution can be found with different techniques available in the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">mathematical market</em>. We plan to further investigate this point using alternative strategies, or optimal search algorithms like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, taking into account biological constraints.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Moreover the model we used is still naive and can be improved greatly. We are working to a more detailed model to dissert the contribution of individual vaccine's components to the protective immune response. We plan also to consider a multi-organ model in order to consider metastasis formation, and the vaccine's effect on metastasis. Work in these directions is in progress and results will be published in due course.</p></div></section>
