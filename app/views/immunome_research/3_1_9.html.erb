The rational design of vaccines consists in part in the identification of appropriate peptides to effect this process.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The task is complicated by the fact that genes of the MHC locus have some of the greatest allelic variability observed among functional loci [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1_19" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>]. Peptides that bind well to one allele may or may not bind well to another.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">A variety of methods for predicting peptide-binding to specific MHC-alleles based on sequence information of the peptides have been developed. A comparative review of some of the most influential approaches, including Weight Matrix Models (WMM), Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be found in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_19" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Prediction algorithms can be categorized broadly into two main classes- those based on pattern recognition and those based on classification. Pattern recognition methods seek to discover similarities among the peptides that bind at high affinity to a given MHC allele (henceforth denoted as "binders"), without considering the properties of non-binders. On the other hand classification methods seek those characteristics that most effectively distinguish binders from non-binders. Pattern recognition-based methods include WMM and motif-based prediction and profile HMM [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3_19" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4_19" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>],. Classification methods include Support vector machines [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5_19" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>] and Classification Trees [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_19" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_19" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>]. These methods and the software implementing them are reviewed in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9_19" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>] and [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10_19" data-toggle="citation">10</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Whether based on classification or pattern discovery, the peptides under investigation must have a representation in an appropriate space. The most commonly used prediction methods employ a simple categorical representation of the amino acids by chemical identity. In this representation, each amino acid is implicitly regarded as equidistant from every other amino acid.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Our aim in this paper is to determine the ability of more structured representations, based on the biophysical properties of the amino acids, with a goal toward improving the effectiveness of standard classification methods. Given that classification must always seek to balance parsimony, or simplicity in the model specification, against accuracy within the training set, a representation based on properties that may play a significant role in determining the binding characteristics of the peptide has a fair chance of supporting models that achieve accuracy with simple models.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">For example, one property of amino acids that is clearly related to protein binding is hydrophobicity. The Kyte-Doolittle [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11_19" data-toggle="citation">11</a></span>] hydrophobicity index induces an order on the amino acids. We may distinguish one set of amino acids, e.g., (R, K, D, E, N, Q, H, P, Y, W, S, T, G) from the remainder (A, M, C, F, I, L, V) by stating that the first set is to contain all amino acids with KD index less than that of A (Alanine). There are 21 ways to form such subsets, or log<sub>2</sub> 21 = 4.4 bits of information to specify the split based on the above ordered set. An arbitrary split into two groups, on the other hand, requires log<sub>2</sub> 2<sup>20</sup> = 20 bits for its specification. Note also that classification based on hydrophobicity when hydrophobicity is not strongly relevant can quickly become inefficient (such as "everything with KD index less than that of alanine, plus phenylalanine and valine; not including arginine, aspartic acid and tryptophan").</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">We do not intend to measure the information required for the specification of each classification model, but instead rely on the natural role of representational simplicity in the performance of classification methods. We may put it another way and ask whether a biophysical encoding makes it easier to find most of the binders by piling them up near each other in feature space, rather than having them scattered more diffusely at the level of individual residues.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">To demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature space representation we compare the performance of several well-known classification methods under both a biophysical amino acid encoding and a simple categorical encoding. This paper does not focus on comparing the classification methods themselves. Instead, for each of the classification methods we compare the performance of the classifiers using the biophysical encoding against the usual categorical encoding.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In addition to effective classification, prediction methods based on amino acid biophysical properties may lend themselves naturally to the development of more comprehensive systems that combine purely empirical methods with <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">de novo</em> or first-principles prediction of peptide binding.</p><section id="Sec2_19" class="Section2 RenderAsSection2">

                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In contrast to the substantial literature on sequence-based peptide binding prediction, there has been relatively little focus on the use of amino acid biophysical properties in binding prediction. Information about the amino acid properties can be used for prediction in several ways. One may, for example, use the real-valued properties themselves in a regression model, or more simply use the order induced by the properties. Alternatively, one can use these properties define new categorical variables and thus natural equivalence classes on the amino acids. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12_19" data-toggle="citation">12</a></span>] used statistical dissimilarity defined on "property models" which showed increased sensitivity over other existing methods. Using the public database on Amino Acid Properties [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13_19" data-toggle="citation">13</a></span>], containing a total of 484 properties, [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14_19" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>] and [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_19" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>] build prediction rules using SVM, decision trees and C4.5 and C5 [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16_19" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17_19" data-toggle="citation">17</a></span>]. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_19" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>] chose a list of 23 properties from different major and minor classes and measured the performance of classification algorithm based on specificity, sensitivity and accuracy. Additionally, the paper summarizes the three most important variables together with the most important positions for each of the MHC-I alleles they consider. On the other hand [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14_19" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>] started with all 484 properties (leaving out the 10 properties containing missing values) and used heuristic algorithm (based on the pairwise correlation coefficients among the properties) to remove redundancy. Finally, they report the misclassification error for C4.5, both with and without bagging, using all the variables that passed the redundancy test.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Using structural information, [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR18_19" data-toggle="citation">18</a></span>] describe a regression model to explain the binding affinity (<em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">pIC</em>

Though none of regression coefficient themselves were statistically significant their approach provided a more desirable leave-one-out cross validation error. Another approach using amino acid biophysical properties has been proposed by [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19_19" data-toggle="citation">19</a></span>]. They employ an encoding based on the biophysical properties to classify the 20 AA into four binary factors: Hydrophobic = {A, V, F, P, M, I, L}, Polar = {S, T, Y, H, C, N, Q, W}, Charged = {D, E, K, R} and Glycine = {G}. This coding assigns a corresponding <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">biochemical signature</em> to each peptide, where each position now belongs to a 4-letter alphabet rather than a 20-letter alphabet. Though this coding does not allow one to distinguish between amino acids with the same code, e.g., Leucine and Isoleucine, it gives a very important partition in reduced dimension, which is particularly relevant for peptide prediction. Using this dimension reduction [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19_19" data-toggle="citation">19</a></span>] report better misclassification error compared to algorithms based on the full unstructured 20-symbol alphabet. Empirical evidence of superiority of property based methods has also been well documented in an array of recent literature including [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20_19" data-toggle="citation">20</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22" data-toggle="citation">22</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR23" data-toggle="citation">23</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24" data-toggle="citation">24</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR25" data-toggle="citation">25</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR26_19" data-toggle="citation">26</a></span>].</p>

                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">While many of the research work mentioned above examined the advantages of using bio-physio-chemical properties for MHC-peptide binding, often under particular classification frameworks, ours is the first article which provides the mathematical rigor of the generalized theory of representing the 9-mer amino acids into the space of amino acid properties. Our method was developed parallel to [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14_19" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>] and [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_19" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>] and is closely related to their approaches. i.e. we use the full metric information of the amino acid properties, but we do not use any metric information of structural parameters. But one major difference to the approaches by [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14_19" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>] and [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_19" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>] is that the properties we analyze are first screened on the basis of their importance based on X-ray crystallography study of peptide binding phenomenon reported in the literature. This screening is based on the crystallographic study, rather than being completely determined by data from AAindex. This step is extremely important, for several reasons. First, the values of AA properties listed in the AAindex are based on experimental data, which are not standardized and often results in discrepant measurement of the same property. Moreover, there exist a lot of redundancy e.g. the database contains three indices, one each for negative, positive and net charge. There are also instances of one index being a more precise version of another index e.g. Electron-ion interaction potential by [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR27_19" data-toggle="citation">27</a></span>] and [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR28_19" data-toggle="citation">28</a></span>]. Finally the properties chosen by exhaustively searching the AAindex is time consuming and often may not be easily interpretable. Our screening of AA properties based on their relevance in binding avoids these difficulties.</p>

Moreover, as our starting set is known a priori to be relevant in MHC binding, the final subset of properties can be directly interpreted and later used to formulate <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">de novo</em> or first-principles prediction of peptide binding. Finally, to our knowledge this is the first research comparing sequence-based and property-based classification of MHC-binding peptides using a number of competitive classification algorithms.</p>

Using the extensive literature in X-Ray crystallography of MHC molecules e.g. in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29_19" data-toggle="citation">29</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR30" data-toggle="citation">30</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR31" data-toggle="citation">31</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR32" data-toggle="citation">32</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR33" data-toggle="citation">33</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR34" data-toggle="citation">34</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR35_19" data-toggle="citation">35</a></span>] available on several MHC-alleles, together with a substantial literature on structural correlates of MHC-binding e.g. in [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR36_19" data-toggle="citation">36</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR37" data-toggle="citation">37</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR38" data-toggle="citation">38</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR39_19" data-toggle="citation">39</a></span>], there is opportunity to assemble a set of properties to serve as our starting set. Given a particular MHC-allele, the MHC-peptide binding is mainly determined by the peptide's back-bone conformation and the interaction of the side-chains with the MHC-binding grooves [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR36_19" data-toggle="citation">36</a></span>]. It is well known that structural properties for different MHC alleles differ considerably, and thus the set of screened properties may be different for different alleles. On the other hand, though the structural details may differ, e.g. the specific anchor positions may differ, the properties governing binding may remain the same. So in this paper we propose to use a common set of properties determined from [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29_19" data-toggle="citation">29</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR30" data-toggle="citation">30</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR31" data-toggle="citation">31</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR32_19" data-toggle="citation">32</a></span>] as the starting set. It should be noted that as our approach includes a model selection step, the final result is independent of the initial set of properties chosen, as long as the set contains all the important properties. So while choosing the starting set we should make a liberal choice and allow the model selection step to choose the final set.</p>

This selection can be performed using two different models- one in which we select the same properties for each positions in the peptide, and the other in which we allow different properties for different positions. Both have their merits and demerits. In this paper we will mostly deal with the first model, in which all the positions are restricted to select the same properties, but it can be easily generalized to the unrestricted form of position specific variable selection.</p>
                                    <p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The purpose of the variable selection step is twofold. On one hand the selected properties should help us design the most parsimonious classification rule based on the training data. On the other hand this step can serve as an exploratory tool, which would provide a quantitative basis for narrowing down on previously unknown peptides, on which laboratory experiments can be performed. (Note: At present, motifs are the basis of narrowing down on possible binders). To illustrate this, let us look at the binding motifs of the set of available binders and non-binders for allele HLA*0201.</p>

Starting with each single property we calculate the average of misclassification errors of 10 runs of a 10-fold classification and choose the property which gives the lowest misclassification error. In the second step, we keep the property selected in the first step and append one property at a time from the previously unselected properties and choose the second property as the pair (with the first property chosen) with lowest misclassification error. This process is continued until their is no gain in misclassification error by adding a new variable. Note that we choose the forward selection algorithm for computing speed but one can also use backward selection or step-wise selection algorithm.</p>

Using this guideline we next choose Volume and using Volume and Hydrophobicity the corresponding CVM decreases to 0.142. Following the same criterion we then include Isoelectric point, branch and aromatic in the given order as the 5 most important variable for the SVM classifier with corresponding CVMs of 0.126, 0.1185 and 0.1183. The next best variable chosen actually increased the CVM, so we stop the process after choosing the 5 variables. Following the same steps, random forest chooses Isoelectric point, Volume and Hydrophobicity in the given order as the 3 most important properties. Including a fourth variable from any of the remaining variables actually increased the CVM. Again following the same selection steps and stopping rule, we choose Hydrophobicity, Area, Isoelectric point and Aromatic as the four most important variables for Bagging.</p>

It is also interesting to note that for each of the classifiers, the single most important variable chosen through minimization of CVM alone performs better than the sequence-based classification. Moreover, for RF and BAG any single property achieves lower misclassification than the sequence-based methods. The last observation can again be supported by the fact that RF and BAG uses the metric values to order the amino acids and we can infer that any single property alone provides a better ordering for predicting the binding affinity than the full information provided by the actual amino acid sequence of the peptide.</p>

So, for comparing the performance of the property based and sequence-based classifiers we use the criterion of Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AROC). The ROC plots the sensitivity vs specificity for a range of tuning parameters chosen for each of the classifiers. We calculate the AROC as a numerical approximation for the area under the ROC curve. This AROC value is a global measure and it ranges between 1 and .5, where the value of 1 corresponds to perfect classification and the value of .5 corresponds to random classification of an observation into one of the two classes. The AROC will, on one hand, enable us to compare the performance of different representations (sequence-based and property based) for the same classifiers and, on the other hand, as it is a global measure, we can compare our classifiers with other competitive methods.</p>

Though these classifiers (SVM, RF and Bagging) are off-the-shelf methods (not especially designed for biological sequence analysis), we observe that the misclassification errors are in the same range as the ones analyzed by [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_19" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>]. For the six classifiers (Bimas, Syfpeithi, Artificial Neural network, HMM, and two developed by the authors namely YK0201, YKW0201) considered by [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_19" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>] the misclassification error ranged from (.81 to .87), the upper range slightly higher than the misclassification error of our sequence-based misclassification errors. But our off-the-shelf property-based classifiers perform even better than these specially-designed classifiers which are based on the sequence. Though we do not make a direct comparison with other classifiers, this study provides enough evidence that any classifier may perform better with carefully chosen properties.</p>

In the future, we have to learn to make vaccines that induce better protective immunity than natural infection is capable of doing. One possible direction is to move toward epitope-based vaccines.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In spite of large quantities of new data, there is still a major role to be played by prediction, since there are 20<sup>9</sup> peptides and more than 1000 MHC alleles. The vast majority of the literature in this field have focused on developing empirically derived techniques, but our approach in this paper provides a single technique to a general methodology and paves the way for further development based on the statistical infrastructure. The property space we propose is designed to effectively capture higher level motif interaction of the binding phenomenon and thus provide the framework for testing scientific hypothesis of peptide-binding phenomenon. The field of peptide binding prediction has matured and now we are faced with huge amounts of binding data on previously unexamined peptides and we believe that the techniques described in this paper will provide the rich mathematical and statistical basis for in-silico binding predictions.</p></div></section>
