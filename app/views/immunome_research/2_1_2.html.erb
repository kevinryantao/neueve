                                <p class="Para">B-cell epitopes are the sites of molecules that are recognized by antibodies of the immune system. Knowledge of B-cell epitopes may be used in the design of vaccines and diagnostics tests. It is therefore of interest to develop improved methods for predicting B-cell epitopes. In this paper, we describe an improved method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes.</p>

                                <p class="Para">In order to do this, three data sets of linear B-cell epitope annotated proteins were constructed. A data set was collected from the literature, another data set was extracted from the AntiJen database and a data sets of epitopes in the proteins of HIV was collected from the Los Alamos HIV database. An unbiased validation of the methods was made by testing on data sets on which they were neither trained nor optimized on. We have measured the performance in a non-parametric way by constructing ROC-curves.</p>

                                <p class="Para">The best single method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes is the hidden Markov model. Combining the hidden Markov model with one of the best propensity scale methods, we obtained the BepiPred method. When tested on the validation data set this method performs significantly better than any of the other methods tested.

For safety reasons, however, it could be desirable to use peptide vaccines that are able to generate an immune response against a given pathogen [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1_8" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>]. Such vaccines could contain peptides representing linear B-cell epitopes from the proteins of the pathogen. Hughes et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_8" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>] used linear B-cell epitopes to induce protective immunity in mice against <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">P. aeruginosa</em>. By immunizing animals, synthetic peptides containing linear B-cell epitopes can also be used to raise antibodies against a specific protein, which e.g. can be used in screening assays or as diagnostic tools [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3_8" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">B-cell epitopes are parts of proteins or other molecules that antibodies (made by B-cells) bind. Most protein epitopes are composed of different parts of the polypeptide chain that are brought into spatial proximity by the folding of the protein. These epitopes are called discontinuous, but for approximately 10% of the epitopes, the corresponding antibodies are cross-reactive with a linear peptide fragment of the epitope [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4_8" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>]. These epitopes are denoted linear or continuous and are mainly composed of a single stretch of the polypeptide chain.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Even though linear B-cell epitopes thus are of limited relevance in the detailed understanding of a humoral immune response, identification of such linear peptide segments will often be the initial step in the search for antigenic determinants in pathogenic organisms. The traditional experimental peptide scanning approach is clearly not feasible on a genomic scale. Prediction methods are very cost effective and reliable methods for predicting linear B-cell epitopes would therefore be a first step in guiding a genome wide search for B-cell antigens in pathogenic organism.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The classical way of predicting linear B-cell epitopes is by the use of propensity scale methods. These methods assign a propensity value to every amino acid, based on studies of their physico-chemical properties. Fluctuations in the sequence of prediction values are reduced by applying a running average window. This prediction procedure was first developed by Hopp and Woods [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5_8" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Pellequer et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4_8" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>] compared several propensity scale methods using a data set of 14 epitope annotated proteins. They found that applying the scales by Parker et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_8" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>] (hydrophilicity), Chou and Fasman [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7_8" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>] and Levitt [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_8" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>] (secondary structure) and by Emini et al.

Odorico [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11_8" data-toggle="citation">11</a></span>] have developed a program, BEPITOPE, for predicting the location of linear B-cell epitopes using propensity scale methods.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Recently, Blythe and Flower [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12_8" data-toggle="citation">12</a></span>] studied the performance of many propensity scale methods and found that even the best methods predict only marginally better than a random model. They made a thorough study using a data set of 50 epitope mapped proteins from the AntiJen web page <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.jenner.ac.uk/AntiJen" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.jenner.ac.uk/AntiJen</span></a></span>[<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13_8" data-toggle="citation">13</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In this study, we have developed a novel method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes, BepiPred, which is found to perform both significantly better than random predictions as well as significantly better than a number of tested propensity scales.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Even though the present method is a significant improvement over earlier methods for predicting linear B-cell epitopes, it still has major limitations. There is a need for further improvements in predictive power before such systems become generally useful to provide reliable predictions of B-cell epitopes.</p></div></section>
