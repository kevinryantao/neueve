From predictions of peptide binding to major histocompatibility complex molecules with moderate accuracy, limited allele coverage, and no good estimates of the other events in the antigen-processing pathway, the field has evolved significantly. Methods have now been developed that produce highly accurate binding predictions for many alleles and integrate both proteasomal cleavage and transport events. Moreover have so-called pan-specific methods been developed, which allow for prediction of peptide binding to MHC alleles characterized by limited or no peptide binding data. Most of the developed methods are publicly available, and have proven to be very useful as a shortcut in epitope discovery. Here, we will go through some of the history of sequence-based predictions of helper as well as cytotoxic T cell epitopes. We will focus on some of the most accurate methods and their basic background.</p></div></section><section xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" class="KeywordGroup Section1 RenderAsSection1 c-section" lang="en"><h2 xmlns="" xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions" xmlns:meta="http://www.springer.com/app/meta" class="Heading js-ToggleCollapseSection c-section__heading" data-sticky-update="true"><a href="#Keywords" data-toggle="collapse" data-toggle-disable-clickoff="" data-target="Keywords">Keywords</a></h2><div class="js-CollapseSection CollapseSection c-section__content" data-test="collapse-section" id="Keywords"><ul class="c-keywords"><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Major Histocompatibility Complex</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Major Histocompatibility Complex Class</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Major Histocompatibility Complex Molecule</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Human Leucocyte Antigen</li><li class="c-keywords__item" itemprop="about">Transporter Associate With Antigen Processing</li></ul></div></section>

On the other hand, this has put an evolutionary pressure on the pathogenic organisms to circumvent the developed protection mechanisms. Especially single-celled organisms and viruses, which generally have a relatively short generation time occasionally combined with a high mutation rate, have succeeded in finding loopholes in the protection. This million-year old arms race has led to the development of a defense system, the immune system, which itself consists of genetically diverse unicellular components that can evolve within the host organism when put under selective pressure. Occasionally, pathogens have evolved that efficiently could infect a specific host organism leading to high mortality. This is typically seen after a change of host [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>]. Obviously, too high mortality among the host species would logically also lead to the pathogenic organism's own end. Due to geographic and biological barriers, such disasters generally hit only locally and were limited to neighboring populations, while physically isolated populations avoided infection [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>]. Today there are no longer any major restrictions on mobility and contact between human populations, which increases the small but present risk of a new pathogen posing a threat for the existing civilization. Several examples from the past few years have further exposed such threats; the SARS outbreak in 2003 did relatively quickly spread to several continents [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span>], and a high mortality has been observed in cases where certain strains of the avian flu, Influenza A H5N1 infect humans [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>]. The recent Influenza A H1N1 pandemic, originating from pigs, is the latest example of how extensive these infections can be [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>]. Fortunately, humans have recently been spared from the emergence of new pathogens that are at the same time both very contagious and extremely deadly. Chronic infections, which have little acute mortality but moderate to high mortality in longer terms are another growing problem. Examples of such are infections with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and tuberculosis (TB).</p></div></section>

Most vaccines today exist as an inactivated or more harmless form of the pathogenic organism. In several cases, there are problems with either the efficacy, side effects, or that the pathogen is constantly changing and thus escapes the vaccine's protection. The latter issue is one of the major obstacles to, for instance, a long lasting Influenza A vaccine. Vaccines take advantage of the features of the adaptive immune system. The immune system in general reacts to foreign substances and organisms when discovered in the body. The innate immune system gives a fast and unspecific response, which does not change with repeated occurrences of the same pathogen. The innate immune response might eliminate the intruder by itself but it also signals to the adaptive part of the immune system [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>]. An existing effective humoral immunity is an extremely potent way of preventing an actual infection as the intruder will be eliminated immediately. For this reason vaccine development has traditionally been focusing on developing effective antibody responses, which can be obtained using totally inactivated pathogens, parts thereof, or even single proteins in case of vaccines against toxins such as tetanus or diphtheria [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span>]. However, to obtain strong and long lasting memory it appears that a strong T cell response is often needed [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>]. The cellular arm of the immune system consists of two parts; cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and helper T lymphocytes (HTLs). Both CTL and HTL recognize peptides that are presented on the cell surface to the immune cells by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, which in humans is referred to as the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA). While HTLs are needed for B cell activation and proliferation to produce antibodies against a given antigen, CTLs perform surveillance of the host cells and recognize and kill infected or malfunctioning cells that present non-self peptides (epitopes) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10" data-toggle="citation">10</a></span>]. In a vaccine context, the relevant proteins expressed by a given pathogen are the proteins that will be determining for a good immune response, i.e., the antigens. The part of the antigen that is recognized by the immune system is the epitope, and in the case of both the CTL and the HTL such epitopes consist of small, 8-20 amino acid long polypeptides.</p></div></section>

To be presented, a precursor peptide is usually first generated by the proteasome, a large cytosomal protease complex [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11" data-toggle="citation">11</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12" data-toggle="citation">12</a></span>]. For further processing, the peptides must enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This generally happens by active transport mediated by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13" data-toggle="citation">13</a></span>]. However, some peptides can enter the ER even with an absent TAP function, as some presented peptides originate from proteins containing a signal peptide. These proteins may enter the ER through the Sec61 transporter complex [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>] and should be considered especially when dealing with infected or malignant cells that might have an impaired TAP function [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>]. This is highly relevant for peptides binding to MHCs belonging to the abundant A2 HLA serotype where TAP independent presentation is responsible for up to 10% of the A2 restricted epitopes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17" data-toggle="citation">17</a></span>]. During or after transport into the ER a potential epitope must bind to the MHC class I molecule [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR18" data-toggle="citation">18</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19" data-toggle="citation">19</a></span>] generally facilitated by the helper protein tapasin [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20" data-toggle="citation">20</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>], before it can finally be presented on the cell surface. The most selective step in the classical MHC class I pathway is binding of a peptide to the MHC molecule. To be an epitope, i.e., to raise a CTL response, a peptide should generally bind with an affinity stronger than 500 nM [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22" data-toggle="citation">22</a></span>]. As a support for this general assumption, Moutaftsi et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR23" data-toggle="citation">23</a></span>] found that of the 49 epitopes that are responsible for 95% of the total CD8+ T cell response against a vaccinia challenge in mice 90% bind MHC with an affinity stronger than 500 nM. The work by Moutaftsi et al. also clearly underlines the usefulness of predictions in vaccine development, as only a very limited subset of peptides derived from the vaccinia proteome had to be tested to identify epitopes responsible for 95% of the CTL response. The tested subset included only the best 1% predicted of all the possible peptides.</p></div></section>

The majority of peptides binding to MHC class I molecules have a length of 8–11 amino acids, even though several longer epitopes have been identified [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24" data-toggle="citation">24</a></span>]. The second position and the C-terminal position of the peptide are typically the most important for binding, and these positions are referred to as anchor positions [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR25" data-toggle="citation">25</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR26" data-toggle="citation">26</a></span>]. For some alleles, the binding motifs further have auxiliary anchor positions. For example, peptides binding to the human HLA-A*0101 allele have position 3 as an additional anchor [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR25" data-toggle="citation">25</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR27" data-toggle="citation">27</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR28" data-toggle="citation">28</a></span>]. Only few different amino acids are tolerated at the anchor positions of peptides binding to a given MHC allele. The discovery of such allele-specific motifs led to the development of the first algorithms for prediction of peptide binding [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR29" data-toggle="citation">29</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR30" data-toggle="citation">30</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR31" data-toggle="citation">31</a></span>], which essentially determined whether a peptide did or did not match the binding ‘motif’ of the MHC molecule.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">As more data has accumulated, it has become possible to go beyond the match/mismatch classification of a motif prediction. By use of statistical methods, scores can be calculated for each possible amino acid at each position in a peptide, leading to an Lx20 scoring matrix where L is the length of the peptide. For predictions, it is then assumed that the amino acids at each position along the peptide sequence contribute a certain binding energy (the score from the matrix), which can independently be added up to yield the overall binding energy of the peptide [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR32" data-toggle="citation">32</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR33" data-toggle="citation">33</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR34" data-toggle="citation">34</a></span>].

These methods differ in the way they derive the matrix coefficients. Some are trained by statistical methods that analyze how often a given amino acid is seen at a given position in binding versus non-binding peptides. Matrix coefficients can also be determined by a machine learning procedure, which aims at finding the coefficients that best explain the observed binding data. This can be done by interpreting the matrix scores for a peptide as predicted binding affinities and by minimizing the distance between predicted and measured values. This is the approach utilized by SMM, which is presently the best performing matrix method in published benchmark studies [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR41" data-toggle="citation">41</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR42" data-toggle="citation">42</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Matrix-based methods cannot take correlated effects into account, i.e., where the contribution to the binding affinity of an amino acid at one position depends on amino acids at other positions in the peptide. Higher order methods like artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are ideally suited to take such correlations into account [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR43" data-toggle="citation">43</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR44" data-toggle="citation">44</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR45" data-toggle="citation">45</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR46" data-toggle="citation">46</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR47" data-toggle="citation">47</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR48" data-toggle="citation">48</a></span>]. These methods can be trained with data either in the format of binder/non-binder classification, e.g. binders from the SYFPEITHI database of eluted peptides [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR36" data-toggle="citation">36</a></span>], or as real affinity data as can be found in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR49" data-toggle="citation">49</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR50" data-toggle="citation">50</a></span>]. Likewise the predictors can either be trained to output a score that correlates with the chance that a given peptide is a binder or to output a score that corresponds to a predicted affinity [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR51" data-toggle="citation">51</a></span>]. The ANN based predictor <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHC</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR45" data-toggle="citation">45</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR47" data-toggle="citation">47</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR52" data-toggle="citation">52</a></span>] was trained using both sequence input from affinity data mainly found in the IEDB as well as output from matrices generated by SYFPEITHI [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR36" data-toggle="citation">36</a></span>] eluted peptides using the Gibbs sampler approach [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR47" data-toggle="citation">47</a></span>]. In two recent benchmark comparisons the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHC-3.0</em> implementation was the most successful method including higher order sequence correlations [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR41" data-toggle="citation">41</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR42" data-toggle="citation">42</a></span>]. The <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHC</em> method has been further improved in the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHC-3.2</em> version (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHC</span></a></span>) by training on data with larger peptide and allelic coverage. (Lundegaard et al., J. Imm. Meth., submitted). As mentioned earlier, most epitopes and MHC binding peptides discovered to date are of length 8, 9, or 10 amino acid residues, even though longer epitopes have been identified, mostly hendecamers, but also a few even longer [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24" data-toggle="citation">24</a></span>]. Data driven prediction-algorithms for MHC class I binding are for the most part limited to predict the same lengths as they have been trained on, and in the IEDB, very few examples of such longer peptides exist today. Of all unique eluted MHC binding peptides in the current version of the IEDB database, only 10% are longer than 10 residues and 4% are longer than 11. Some MHC:peptide binding methods have been developed using the information of the three dimensional structure of known complexes. These methods should in principle be able to predict binding also of longer peptides. However, not even on nonamer peptides are these methods as accurate as the data driven methods [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR53" data-toggle="citation">53</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR54" data-toggle="citation">54</a></span>], and have to our knowledge not been benchmarked on longer peptides. It has been shown, though, that predictions from methods trained on nonamer peptides can be used to predict the affinity of longer peptides, which has been benchmarked with peptides of a length up to 11 residues [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR55" data-toggle="citation">55</a></span>]. This system has been implemented into the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHC</em> method. To summarize: of the prediction methods publicly available online, the neural network based <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHC</em> performs best on the tested evaluation sets, followed by the matrix based <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">SMM</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR41" data-toggle="citation">41</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR42" data-toggle="citation">42</a></span>]. The <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">SMM</em> training and prediction code is freely available [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR39" data-toggle="citation">39</a></span>]. The implementation of online consensus MHC class I prediction tools is currently in progress at the IEDB site (Björn Peters, personal communication), as an approach of combining different prediction methods might give even better results [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR56" data-toggle="citation">56</a></span>]. How accurate the best of methods are can be exemplified by comparing the prediction accuracy of the single methods with the correlation between different experimental methods [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR42" data-toggle="citation">42</a></span>].

Initially only the most common alleles were examined, but it was soon clear that some alleles were sharing peptide preferences often, which did not always correlate with the amino acid sequence similarity of the compared alleles [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR57" data-toggle="citation">57</a></span>].

This database is now very extensive both in terms of the number of different peptides and the number of different MHC alleles for which binding data exist. Furthermore, the MHC class I binding data are very homogeneous in quality as more than 99% of the quantitative binding data in the IEDB database generated since 2006 were generated by two comparable assays developed in the laboratories of A. Sette and S. Buus [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR64" data-toggle="citation">64</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR65" data-toggle="citation">65</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR66" data-toggle="citation">66</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR67" data-toggle="citation">67</a></span>]. More than 95% of the class I data has been generated since 2005, and less than 2% before 2001. However, besides leading to MHC prediction systems, which now cover a large number of different HLA alleles [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR42" data-toggle="citation">42</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR68" data-toggle="citation">68</a></span>], this large growth in the amount of MHC peptide-binding data has enabled the development of new so-called pan-specific algorithms. These pan-specific methods go beyond the conventional single allele approach and are able to predict peptide-binding to HLA alleles, for which the sequence is known but only limited or no experimental binding data are available [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR68" data-toggle="citation">68</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR69" data-toggle="citation">69</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR70" data-toggle="citation">70</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR71" data-toggle="citation">71</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR72" data-toggle="citation">72</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR73" data-toggle="citation">73</a></span>]. The architecture of the training system of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHCpan</em> has been outlined in a way that takes both the peptide sequence and the MHC contact environment into account (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig2">2</a></span>). Polymorphic positions in the MHC assumed to be in contact with a residue in a bound peptide have been mapped in order to extract a pseudo sequence representing the given MHC molecule [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR72" data-toggle="citation">72</a></span>]. This pseudo sequence is used as input in the training coupled with a peptide sequence and the measured affinity of the given peptide:MHC. Thus, the machine learning method behind the predictions is trained to be able to combine the information provided by the MHC sequence and the peptide sequence in order to predict a specific binding affinity. In this way, the system can combine information from the MHC sequence with the peptide sequence to derive cross correlations and is able to predict the outcome of MHC:peptide combinations that it has not encountered during the training. Several pan-HLA methods have been evaluated in a large-scale benchmark, and the outcome of this evaluation demonstrated the power of the pan-specific methods. Not only do these methods predict peptide-binding affinities to previously uncharacterized MHC molecules but the incorporated training setup also boosts the predictive performance for already characterized alleles by leveraging information from neighboring MHC molecules [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR74" data-toggle="citation">74</a></span>], see Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab1">1</a></span>. <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Kiss</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR70" data-toggle="citation">70</a></span>] is available from <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://cbio.ensmp.fr/kiss/" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://cbio.ensmp.fr/kiss/</span></a></span>, <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ADT</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR71" data-toggle="citation">71</a></span>] is available at <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://atom.research.microsoft.com/hlabinding/" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://atom.research.microsoft.com/hlabinding/</span></a></span>, and <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHCpan</em> [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR72" data-toggle="citation">72</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR73" data-toggle="citation">73</a></span>] is available at <span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan</span></a></span>.

The proteins responsible for these events are basically monomorphic, and developers of prediction methods do not face the same allele problem as is present for MHC binding prediction. This should in principle make the task of developing accurate prediction methods easier. This is, however, not the case as the assays determining the cleavage and binding are not developed for high throughput to the same extent as is the case for MHC:peptide binding assays. For this reason data for these two processing events are in general scarce.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The complex enzymatic specificity of the proteasome makes the prediction of its cleavage patterns highly challenging. The proteasome comprises multiple catalytically active sites, each with a distinct specificity [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR75" data-toggle="citation">75</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR76" data-toggle="citation">76</a></span>]. A further complication is that two versions of the proteasome exist. The proteasome that functions in most cells and which has the main task of recycling superfluous or malfunctioning proteins is constitutively expressed and is therefore called the constitutive proteasome. An inducible version of the proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is expressed when a cell receives signals from the innate or the adaptive immune system indicating that it should enter an ‘alarm’ state. The immunoproteasome has catalytic subunits with different specificity than the constitutive proteasome. This change gives rise to a catalytic complex, which cleaves proteins into fragments that are better processed by the other players in the MHC class I pathway [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR77" data-toggle="citation">77</a></span>]. The outcome of proteasomal cleavage has been considered in two separate ways when it comes to predictive purposes. One way is to predict the chance of a given position in the protein sequence to be cleaved. Another approach is to predict the likelihood that a given peptide fragment will arise after proteasomal cleavage. <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">FragPredict</em>, which is publicly available as a part of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">MAPPP</em> service (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/MAPPP/" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/MAPPP/</span></a></span>), takes the latter approach and consists of two sequential algorithms. The first algorithm uses a statistical analysis of cleavage-enhancing and -inhibiting amino acid motifs to predict potential proteasomal cleavage sites [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR78" data-toggle="citation">78</a></span>]. The second algorithm predicts the likelihood that a given peptide fragment will arise using the results of the first algorithm as an input. The second algorithm has been developed to select the most likely fragments to be generated. The model calculates the time-dependent degradation based on a kinetic model of the 20S proteasome [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR79" data-toggle="citation">79</a></span>]. The <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">PAProC</em> (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.paproc.de" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.paproc.de</span></a></span>) method predicts in vitro proteasomal cleavages performed by human and wild type and mutant yeast proteasomes. The influence of different amino acids at different positions is determined by using a stochastic hill-climbing algorithm [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR80" data-toggle="citation">80</a></span>] based on the experimentally verified in vitro cleavage and non-cleavage sites [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR81" data-toggle="citation">81</a></span>]. A weight matrix method has been developed which predicts both constitutive- and immunoproteasomal cleavage specificity [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR82" data-toggle="citation">82</a></span>] trained on the very limited in vitro proteasomal digest data available. The NetChop [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR83" data-toggle="citation">83</a></span>] method has been trained using information from C termini of naturally processed MHC class I ligands. No other significant endopeptidases or exopeptidases processing the C-terminus of peptides have been observed in the cell compartments involved in the class I pathway. Therefore the C-termini of MHC I presented peptides are believed to be created by proteasomal cleavage. Since some of these ligands are generated by the immunoproteasome and some by the constitutive proteasome, such a method should predict the combined specificity of both forms of proteasomes. <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetChop-2.0</em> was evaluated to be the best-performing predictor on an independent evaluation set [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR84" data-toggle="citation">84</a></span>]. The SVM based <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">Pcleavage</em> proteasomal cleavage predictor, which is available online, has a published performance comparable to that of NetChop-2.0 [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR85" data-toggle="citation">85</a></span>]. An update of the NetChop method to version 3.0 [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR77" data-toggle="citation">77</a></span>] consists of a combination of several ANNs, each trained using a different sequence-encoding scheme of the data. NetChop-3.0 (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetChop" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetChop</span></a></span>) has an increased sensitivity as compared to NetChop-2.0, without lowering the specificity. A method using SVM predictions and apparently achieving very good results has recently been published [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR86" data-toggle="citation">86</a></span>]. In their evaluation, however, the developers do not compare AROC/AUC values, described by [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR87" data-toggle="citation">87</a></span>], which is the best suitable value for comparison of the performance of these kind of predictors [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR53" data-toggle="citation">53</a></span>]. The method is not available as software, code, or server, and still awaits independent evaluation. Finally, a new method predicting the likelihood that a given peptide originates from proteasomal cleavage has been implemented as a publicly available server (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://peptibase.cs.biu.ac.il/PepCleave_II/" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://peptibase.cs.biu.ac.il/PepCleave_II/</span></a></span>) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR88" data-toggle="citation">88</a></span>], and according to the published evaluation this method works well. Good benchmarks for a comparison of the usefulness of the different types of predictions have not yet been implemented.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Relatively few methods have been developed to predict the specificity of TAP. Daniel et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR89" data-toggle="citation">89</a></span>] have developed ANNs using 9-mer peptides, for which the TAP affinity was determined experimentally. Surprisingly, they found that some MHC alleles such as alleles belonging to the HLA-A*02 family have some natural ligands with very low TAP affinities. This could either be because TAP ligands can be trimmed in the ER before binding to MHC molecules [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR90" data-toggle="citation">90</a></span>] and that a TAP ligand therefore often enters the ER as a precursor to the MHC binding peptide, or it could be due to alternative entrance routes, as described earlier. Peters et al.

However, while <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">TAPREG</em> works only for nonamer peptide predictions, the SMM based method was further generalized to work on peptides that are longer than 9 amino acids.

Thus, the affinity of peptides longer than 9 amino acid residues can be predicted by using matrix scores only for the three N terminal residues and the C terminal residue in the peptide.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The action of ERAAP peptidase has also been shown to be important for peptide binding [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR24" data-toggle="citation">24</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR94" data-toggle="citation">94</a></span>], and the importance of tapasin in the class I presentation pathway has recently become evident [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20" data-toggle="citation">20</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR95" data-toggle="citation">95</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR96" data-toggle="citation">96</a></span>].

All of these methods attempt to predict antigen presentation by integrating peptide:MHC binding predictions with one or more of the other events involved in the antigen presentation pathway. How well do these methods perform, and which of the methods work best? In a benchmark, a set of verified epitopes can be used as the positive data set. But having only positive data, it is only possible to get a sensitivity score, and methods that will predict any peptide as an epitope will reach the highest rank. On the other hand, a negative data set (containing peptides that cannot induce an immune response) is difficult to define because it is impossible to guarantee that a peptide will never be an epitope in any individual expressing a given HLA allele. To circumvent this problem, epitopes from extensively studied pathogens, such as HIV, are often used as the positive set, and all other peptides that are present in the whole proteome of the same pathogen and have never been shown to give an immune response are chosen as the negative set (non-epitopes), thus assuming that they will at least have a very low probability of being epitopes. A comparison has been published calculating the predictive performance of several publicly available MHC-I presentation prediction methods [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR104" data-toggle="citation">104</a></span>]. The outcome, using such a large-scale benchmark on known HIV epitopes (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/suppl/immunology/CTL-1.2/HIV_dataset" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/suppl/immunology/CTL-1.2/HIV_dataset</span></a></span>) revealed that the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetCTL</em> and <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">MHCpathway</em> methods were ranked the most accurate with &gt;75% of the epitopes ranking among the top 5% peptides sorted by the prediction score [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR104" data-toggle="citation">104</a></span>]. The majority of the described methods only work for a limited number of MHC alleles. To date only the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetCTLpan</em> method has integrated the described pan-specific MHC binding prediction systems with predictions of proteasomal cleavage and TAP translocation [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR98" data-toggle="citation">98</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">When testing predicted epitopes for response in patients or donors the success rate is around 10% depending on selected cutoff and pathogen [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR23" data-toggle="citation">23</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR105" data-toggle="citation">105</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR106" data-toggle="citation">106</a></span>]. Since the affinity predictions are far more accurate than this there might be other issues to address. These could be inherent issues such as stability of the peptide:MHC complex (half life), the influence of tapasin on successful MHC loading, MHC competition, or holes in the T cell repertoire.

The epitope recognized by a helper TCR is usually somehow connected to the epitope that is recognized by the B cell receptor, but the two different receptors do not necessarily recognize overlapping epitopes or even epitopes from the same protein. T cells can recognize internal peptides that do not need to be a part of the surface-surface interactions with the B cell receptor. HTLs, which normally carry the CD4 receptor and are therefore also called CD4+ T cells, recognize peptides presented by the MHC class II molecule on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes. Peptides presented by class II MHCs usually originate from internalized proteins, thus, class II peptide presentation follows a different path than the MHC class I presentation pathway [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR108" data-toggle="citation">108</a></span>]. In short, MHC class II molecules associate with the invariant chain (Ii) in the ER and the MHC:Ii complexes accumulate in endosomal compartments. Here, Ii is degraded, while another MHC-like molecule which in humans is called HLA-DM, loads the MHC class II molecules with the best available ligands originating from endocytosed antigens that have been degraded in the lysosomes partly simultaneously with the MHC maturation process. The peptide:MHC class II complexes are subsequently transported to the cell surface for presentation.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In contrast to MHC class I, peptide affinity data for MHC class II have been generated using a diverse set of experimental assays by a large number of different groups. About 80% of the quantitative data has been produced using one single assay type, whereas 20 groups using more than five different assay types produced the remaining 20%. Less than 80% of the data were produced after 2006, and more than 15% of the data were produced before 2001 [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR109" data-toggle="citation">109</a></span>]. Most binding data describing the specificity of MHC molecules are equilibrium binding affinity values. Binding affinity might not be the only relevant feature for the characterization of epitopes. Binding stability might be equally relevant because the avidity of the MHC peptide complex to bind T cells clearly depends both on the equilibrium binding constant and the stability of the complex. Complementing the MHC binding data with peptide stability measurements may, thus, lead to improved epitope predictions. As a result of the open ends of the MHC class II binding cleft, peptides may bind in multiple registers. Several conflicting studies have shown both positive and negative effects of including such multiple binding registers into the prediction of MHC class II binding, and no consensus has been reached in the field as to how big the effect of multiple binding registers would be for an accurate description of the binding specificity. Finally, for naturally processed MHC ligands and CD4 epitopes, factors other than peptide–MHC binding can influence the peptide immunogenicity, including susceptibility to proteolytic activity in the endosome/lysosome and peptide/antigen abundance in the antigen-presenting cell.</p></div></section>

As a result MHC class II binding peptides have a broader length distribution typically of eleven to twenty residues [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR111" data-toggle="citation">111</a></span>]. However, the majority of the binding interaction is mediated by a 9 amino acid residue core sequence of the bound peptide. This complicates binding predictions, as the identification of the correct alignment of the binding core is a crucial part of identifying the MHC class II binding motif [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR38" data-toggle="citation">38</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR56" data-toggle="citation">56</a></span>]. Identifying this core is difficult, as the MHC class II binding motifs have relatively weak and often degenerate sequence signals. The majority of MHC class II binding prediction methods are based on the assumption that the peptide–MHC binding affinity is determined solely from a nine amino acid binding core motif. An early effort, <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">TEPITOPE</em> developed by Jürgen Hammer [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR112" data-toggle="citation">112</a></span>], used this assumption. The data were obtained by phage display and binding to a selected set of HLA-DRB1 molecules with a changing central 9mer core of the presented peptide. Position specific scoring matrices (PSSM) were derived using statistical analysis of the amino acids observed at each position in binding versus non-binding peptide cores. Such PSSMs were generated for a number of selected HLA-DRB1 alleles and, using structurally derived data, the anchor positions in the peptides were associated with certain binding pockets in the MHC molecule. Assuming that these binding pockets were mutually independent, virtual PSSMs for HLA-DRB1 alleles, for which no data was available, were created by matching amino acid pocket residues of the uncharacterized allele to pockets for the alleles with characterized binding motif. For a long time, this method was the best method for MHC class II binding prediction. Since <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">TEPITOPE</em> was originally only made available for PC use, the PSSMs were later derived from publications and made publicly available as a part of the web accessible class II predictor <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ProPred</em> (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/propred/" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/propred/</span></a></span>) [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR113" data-toggle="citation">113</a></span>]. Even though binding data became available for naturally processed peptides, e.g., from SYFPEITHI [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR36" data-toggle="citation">36</a></span>] it proved difficult to make prediction systems that significantly exceed the accuracy of <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">TEPITOPE</em>/<em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ProPred</em>. One of the major obstacles has been the identification of the 9mer binding core within these generally longer peptides. Several attempts have been made using more sophisticated methods such as Gibbs sampling [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR38" data-toggle="citation">38</a></span>] or SVMs [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR114" data-toggle="citation">114</a></span>]. The assumption that binding can be predicted from a 9mer core alone is clearly an oversimplification as it is known that peptide flanking residues (PFR) on both sides of the binding core may contribute to the binding affinity and stability of the peptide:MHC complex [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR115" data-toggle="citation">115</a></span>]. Some methods for MHC class II binding have attempted to include PFRs indirectly, in terms of the peptide length, in the affinity prediction [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR116" data-toggle="citation">116</a></span>]. Later, it was demonstrated that including PFRs in MHC class II predictions does in fact improve the prediction accuracy [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR117" data-toggle="citation">117</a></span>]. The method SMM-align (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII-1.1" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII-1.1</span></a></span>), which implements this approach, has been shown to perform best by independently conducted validations [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR56" data-toggle="citation">56</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR118" data-toggle="citation">118</a></span>]. Most of the methods for MHC class II binding predictions have been trained and evaluated on very limited data sets covering only a single or a few different MHC class II alleles, making it very difficult to compare the different performance values and establish generality of the methods. A recent large-scale comparison of prediction methods for MHC class II binding [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR56" data-toggle="citation">56</a></span>] covered 14 HLA-DR (human MHC) and two mouse class II alleles. Recently, an ANN-based method, NN-align (<span class="ExternalRef"><a href="http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII-2.2" target="_blank" class="ext-link"><span class="RefSource">http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCII-2.2</span></a></span>), has been published [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR119" data-toggle="citation">119</a></span>] as an extension to the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">SMM-align</em> method. As depicted in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3">3</a></span>, the <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NN-align</em> method uses the current weights optimized in the previous training round to select the optimal 9mer core and PFRs for each of the peptides within the training set. The ANN weights are then optimized on the basis of the errors between the predicted binding affinity using the newly defined core and PRFs. Now, the cores and PFRs are in turn redefined based on the new weights and the iteration is continued until the error ceases to decrease on an external part of the training set not used to optimize the weights. This method works significantly better than previously published methods, but awaits external independent evaluation. Besides the previously described 14 HLA-DR alleles, the updated <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">NetMHCII-2.2</em> method includes prediction for six of the most common HLA-DQ and DP alleles. <figure xmlns="" class="Figure" id="Fig3"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="MediaObject">

Genome wide screening procedures will often identify thousands of potential epitope candidates caused by genomic diversity of the pathogen and the HLA allelic diversity of a given host population. Due to economic and practical limitations, only a small set of epitope candidates can be handled in subsequent epitope validation assays. Several methods have been published recently aiming at identifying a peptide subset that will provide optimal pathogen genomic and HLA coverage in a given population [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR105" data-toggle="citation">105</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR123" data-toggle="citation">123</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR124" data-toggle="citation">124</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR125" data-toggle="citation">125</a></span>]. The method by Fischer et al. aims at designing mosaic protein with maximal 9-mer peptide coverage of the pathogen genomic diversity. The EpiSelect method described by Perez et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR105" data-toggle="citation">105</a></span>] aims at identifying sets of CTL epitopes with maximum coverage of the genomic variation of the pathogen. All available variants of an organism of interest are screened for peptides predicted to bind to a given allele or supertype representative. The peptide-binder predicted to be present in most of the variable pathogenic strains is selected first. In repetitive selection rounds, new predicted binders are selected according to a scheme that maximizes the overall coverage of the pathogenic strains and leaves as few strains as possible uncovered. This algorithm thus goes one step further than the method by Fischer et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR123" data-toggle="citation">123</a></span>], and includes the HLA restriction in the peptide selection. In the published study, epitopes were predicted for allele representatives of 9 supertypes using NetCTL. For each of the supertypes, peptides were consecutively selected by the EpiSelect scheme. Of 184 peptides tested against blood monocytes from 31 HIV patients infected with various HIV subtypes 114 (62%) were recognized by at least one study subject, and 45 were novel epitopes. Using the EpiSelect algorithm, Perez et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR105" data-toggle="citation">105</a></span>] were able to demonstrate how it is possible to detect and evaluate both the magnitude and breadth of epitope-specific CTL responses in a genetically diverse population infected with different HIV subtypes using a very limited set of HLA class I supertype-restricted epitopes, thus demonstrating the high power of these methods. An alternative approach was taken in the work by Toussaint et al. [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR125" data-toggle="citation">125</a></span>] where a set of peptides with maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response was selected from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes covering different HLA alleles and pathogen genomic variants.</p></div></section>

Even from this scarce amount of data, it was found that prediction of new potential epitopes could be performed with a decent accuracy. The large polymorphism of the MHC genomic region and especially of the MHC genes themselves became more and more clear. This challenged the usefulness of identified epitopes as vaccines since many epitopes would be needed to cover a reasonable part of a given population, which would require tremendous resources to be invested in the experimental validation of the predicted epitopes. For more than a decade, the supertype concept has been a highly valuable tool for limiting the number of epitopes needed in an epitope-based vaccine with broad population coverage. However, recent studies have demonstrated that supertypes do provide a strong oversimplification of the peptide binding diversity of the different MHC molecules, and that different MHC alleles within a given supertype often will restrict very different peptide repertoires [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR126" data-toggle="citation">126</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR127" data-toggle="citation">127</a></span>]. To entail a detailed understanding of which T cell epitopes can be restricted by a given host, it has therefore become apparent that full HLA typing is required in combination with the recent advances in pan-specific MHC class I binding predictions. Several large scale studies have demonstrated that based on such detailed information, the vast majority of positive T cell responses can be explained [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR128" data-toggle="citation">128</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR129" data-toggle="citation">129</a></span>]. These studies also underline that supertype associations may lead to poor or even wrong interpretations of the observed immune correlates.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">Despite the great advances in the accuracy and allelic coverage of methods for prediction of peptide binding to MHC molecules, a great proportion of recent papers published on the subject of rational T cell epitope discovery apply relatively ancient methods like <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">BIMAS</em> and <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">SYPHITHI</em> for MHC class I and <em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">TEPITOPE</em>/<em xmlns="" class="EmphasisTypeItalic">ProPred</em> for MHC class II [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR109" data-toggle="citation">109</a></span>]. This is surprising because many benchmark studies have shown that state-of-the-art data-driven methods significantly outperform these older methods also when it comes to identification of MHC ligands and T cell epitopes.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">It is apparent that at present MHC:peptide binding in silico models can significantly enhance the outcome of epitope discovery experiments. However, there is no doubt that human interpretation by experienced immunologists is necessary in order to correctly interpret and validate the outcome of such prediction systems. Today the most fruitful work seems to be done in collaborations between experimentalists and bioinformaticians.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">The CTL epitope prediction algorithms are today at a level of accuracy where they have already been proven useful in high throughput and full genome based epitope discovery. This gives hope that the methods themselves can be used as analytic tools for investigations of systems biology nature e.g., host/pathogen interactions, and simulate the development of the immune system under specific stimuli. We do strongly believe that in the near future the number of MHC class II binding data will increase significantly, which will lead to the development of new predictive methods and will enhance the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, ongoing experiments indicate, that class II predictions, even at the current level, can be of significant help in Th epitope discovery efforts (Annika Karlsson, personal communication).</p></div></section>
