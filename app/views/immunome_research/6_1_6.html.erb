                                <p class="Para">One of the major challenges in the field of vaccine design is to predict conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen. In the past, several methods have been developed for predicting conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen from its tertiary structure. This is the first attempt in this area to predict conformational B-cell epitope in an antigen from its amino acid sequence.</p>

                                <h3 xmlns="" class="Heading">Results</h3>
                                <p class="Para">All Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained and tested on 187 non-redundant protein chains consisting of 2261 antibody interacting residues of B-cell epitopes. Models have been developed using binary profile of pattern (BPP) and physiochemical profile of patterns (PPP) and achieved a maximum MCC of 0.22 and 0.17 respectively. In this study, for the first time SVM model has been developed using composition profile of patterns (CPP) and achieved a maximum MCC of 0.73 with accuracy 86.59%. We compare our CPP based model with existing structure based methods and observed that our sequence based model is as good as structure based methods.</p>

These B-cell epitopes can be categorized into two classes, continuous and discontinuous. A continuous/linear epitope is a segment of consecutive residues in the primary sequence while a discontinuous/conformational epitope is a bunch of residues of an antigen that are far away from each other in the primary sequence but are brought to spatial proximity as a result of polypeptide folding. It is also known that most of the B-cell epitope (~90%) are conformational epitope. Both types of epitopes play an important role in the peptide-based vaccines and disease diagnosis [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR1_44" data-toggle="citation">1</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR2_44" data-toggle="citation">2</a></span>]. One of the beauties of immune system is that it recognizes the foreign proteins/antigens and generate specific antibody against these antigens. This potential of immune system has been exploited by researchers for designing subunit vaccines [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR3_44" data-toggle="citation">3</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR4_44" data-toggle="citation">4</a></span>].</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In the post genomic era where a large number of pathogens have been completely sequenced, it is crucial to identify B-cell epitope or here after called antibody interacting residues in an antigen for the design of subunit vaccines against these pathogens. In the past several experimental techniques have been developed for mapping antibody interacting residues on an antigen that includes identification of interacting residues from structure of antibody-antigen complexes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5_44" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>]. One of the popular approaches is overlapping peptide synthesis covering the entire antigen sequence, which identifies mainly sequential epitopes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR6_44" data-toggle="citation">6</a></span>]. Mapping of antibody interacting residues has been severely hampered by the costly and time taking process of 3D structure determination. Many tools, covering compilation, visualization and prediction of B and T cell epitopes have been developed [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR7_44" data-toggle="citation">7</a></span>]. Despite of majority of epitopes being conformational, most of the computational methods and databases centered at the sequential epitopes [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR8_44" data-toggle="citation">8</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR9" data-toggle="citation">9</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR10_44" data-toggle="citation">10</a></span>]. Linear epitope prediction methods can be categorized into physico-chemical property [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR11_44" data-toggle="citation">11</a></span>], HMM [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR12_44" data-toggle="citation">12</a></span>] and ANN based [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR13_44" data-toggle="citation">13</a></span>]. Many methods are available for antibody interacting residues identification if antigen's or its homolog's tertiary structure is known which in itself is a big limitation. These are based on features like flexibility, solvent accessibility [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR14_44" data-toggle="citation">14</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_44" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>] and amino acid propensity scales [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16_44" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>]. Earlier researchers created a benchmark dataset from the 3D PDB structures and evaluated several structure-based protein-protein binding site prediction methods which included popular CEP [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR15_44" data-toggle="citation">15</a></span>] and DiscoTope [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR16_44" data-toggle="citation">16</a></span>] for predicting immunogenic regions [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR17_44" data-toggle="citation">17</a></span>]. They opted the definition, that epitope consist of antigen residues in which any atom of the antigen residue is separated from any antibody atom by a distance of ≤ 4Å. They found that the performance of all methods were mediocre and no method could achieve Area under curve (AUC) greater than 0.7. In addition to these a bunch of improved methods have been developed for the prediction of antibody interacting residues if tertiary structure of antigen is known [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR18_44" data-toggle="citation">18</a></span><span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR19" data-toggle="citation">19</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR20" data-toggle="citation">20</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR21" data-toggle="citation">21</a></span>, <span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR22" data-toggle="citation">22</a></span>, </span><span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR23_44" data-toggle="citation">23</a></span>]. In summary, one needs to determine structure of antigen using crystallography in order to identify antibody interacting residues in antigen. The experimental techniques like crystallography are expensive and time consuming where as functional assays are not reliable enough [<span class="CitationRef"><a href="#CR5_44" data-toggle="citation">5</a></span>]. Thus there is need to develop alternate technique for predicting antibody interacting residues in a protein.</p><p xmlns:func="http://oscar.fig.bmc.com" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="Para">In this study attempt has been made to predict antibody interacting residues in an antigen from its primary sequence. First we created the patterns of different window lengths from the corresponding amino acid sequences then used the standard binary and physico-chemical profiles of patterns. We have introduced for the first time the concept of composition profile of pattern (CPP) generated through sliding window where the central residue is antibody interacting. These features were used to develop SVM based models to predict antibody interacting residues with high accuracy.</p></div></section>

It will produce two types of patterns positive and negative, positive patterns have antibody interacting central residue. These patterns are used to train machine-learning techniques for developing models. In real life only few residues in an antigen are recognized by antibody or B-cell receptor. This means that the number of negative patterns will be much higher than positive patterns in our training dataset; for 2261 positive patterns there were 107414 negative patterns. This creates two problems; i) poor performance of models due to imbalanced set of patterns and ii) training of models is time consuming and CPU intensive. Thus in this study we have used two pattern sets for learning our models; i) realistic set of patterns that includes all negative patterns and ii) balance set of patterns having equal number of positive and negative patterns. In case of balance set, we randomly picked up equal number of negatives from negative pattern set.</p>

As shown in Additional file <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM1_44">1</a></span>, Figure S6, composition profile of positive and negative patterns are different. This means that positive and negative patterns can be discriminated from their amino acid composition. Based on this observation, we developed SVM models for predicting antibody interacting residues in proteins using composition profile of patterns (CPP). The performance of CPP based SVM models have been shown in Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab3_44">3</a></span>. It is surprising that simple composition based model outperforms BPP and CPP based models. We achieved maximum MCC 0.73 with accuracy 86.59% at window length 19. Detail performance of CPP based SVM model for window length 19 is shown in Additional file <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#MOESM1_44">1</a></span>, Table S5. The performance improved significantly for almost all window sizes as compared to binary or physico-chemical properties. As shown in Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig3_44">3</a></span>, we achieved area under curve (AUC) 0.90 which is significantly better than AUC achieved using BPP and PPP based models.

All window size patterns were made unique and divided into realistic and balance set of patterns. Realistic set of patterns represents the real-life situation where non interacting residues are much higher than interacting residues. We trained and tested our models on benchmark dataset using balance set of patterns and achieved MCC 0.13 and 0.72 for BPP and CPP respectively (Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab4_44">4</a></span>). These results demonstrates that CPP based models are also effective on benchmark dataset. In order to make evaluation more realistic, we also trained and tested our models using realistic set of patterns based on BPP and achieved MCC 0.06 and 0.44 for BPP and CPP respectively. MCC decreases when we used realistic set of patterns instead of balance set of patterns but accuracy was nearly the same in both cases. In order to compare performance of our model with existing methods we also measured performance in term of AUC. Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4_44">4</a></span> shows the ROC plot of our models on benchmark dataset, we achieved AUC 0.56, 0.57 0.89 for models based on BPP, PPP and CPP respectively. These results demonstrate that CPP based models are more accurate than other models. AUC was more than 0.85 for both set of patterns, realistic and balance (Figure <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Fig4_44">4</a></span>). We compared performance of our model with existing methods (Table <span class="InternalRef"><a href="#Tab5_44">5</a></span>) and observed that our model is as good as any other method. This means our model may complement existing methods and can be used when structure of the antigen is not available.<figure xmlns="" id="Tab4_44" class="FigureTable"><figcaption class="Caption" lang="en"><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="CaptionContent"><span class="CaptionNumber">Table 4</span>

The server is developed using CGI-Perl script, HTML and installed on a Sun Server (420E) under UNIX (Solaris 7) environment. The user may submit the amino acid sequence(s) in 'FASTA' format. The server generates the 19 window patterns of all submitted sequences, calculates amino acid composition and predicts antibody interacting residues. The output is the amino acid sequence mapped with a probability scale ranging from 0 to 9 for each amino acid. 0 indicates the rarest chance of being that residue in a B-cell epitope and 9 as the most probable. We suggest that for high specificity (high confidence) prediction, user should select the higher threshold value but compromising the sensitivity of prediction. However, for maximum prediction of antibody interacting residues user should opt lower threshold. There is always interplay between sensitivity and specificity. The default threshold was set at -0.3 as at this value, sensitivity and specificity was found equal during the development.

Much effort has been put in trying to predict the conformational B-cell epitope. Previous methods predict conformational B-cell epitopes with reasonably high accuracy, the limitation of these methods is that they require tertiary structure of the antigen. Experimental technique like X-ray crystallography used for determining structure of a protein is costly, tedious and time consuming. To the best of author's knowledge there is no method which can predict conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen in absence of tertiary structure. There is a need to develop methods for predicting conformational B-cell epitopes in an antigen from its primary sequence. This study describes the method CBTOPE developed for predicting conformational epitopes of antibody interacting residues in antigens. In order to compare performance of our models we chose a benchmark dataset, which was used to evaluate the performance of structure based methods. In order to increase the data we included data from IEDB database. We presumed that the antibody interacting residues are the conformational B-cell epitope residues. We used traditional features of binary and physico-chemical profiles of patterns, evaluated by 5-fold cross validation while using SVM as a classifier. Performance was very poor in BPP models due to the fact that for 21xW vector size only W values represent 1, the rest all are 0 so the noise is more in BPP model. PPP model also could not perform well although it was earlier used for linear and structure based conformational B-cell epitope prediction. From the preliminary analysis of the composition and 2 sample logo plots of positive and negative patterns, it was clear that there is significant difference in the composition and surface propensities of certain residues which can be exploited to discriminate the patterns. Finally we used for the first time, in our study simple amino acid composition model of patterns (CPP) with vector size of 20 which was evaluated on two different datasets. The performance improved significantly and it is interesting to note that it can be used for the prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes despite the fact that in CPP model we lost the amino acid order information unlike BPP. This problem may be equated to the sub-cellular localization of proteins wherein it was observed that simple amino acid composition model perform better than other features. But unlike sub-cellular localization we exploited composition of patterns instead of whole protein sequence. It should be noted that despite the prediction of antibody interacting or individual B-cell epitope residues, being a sequence based method and the lack of 3D structural input, CBTOPE cannot assist in determining the number and distance needed to make an epitope segment in the antigen sequence. This information can be obtained by mapping of the predicted residues on the modeled structure. We hope that the present model is unique in its kind and will compliment the available structure based methods used for the prediction of antibody interacting residues or conformational B-cell epitopes.</p></div></section>
